A lot of headache comes simply because people don't ask enough questions.

## Better now than Later
One question to consider is "How is yor acquaintanceship?" The longer and better you know someone before marriage, the greater the likelihood of marital satisfaction.

Some of these questions are going to be uncomfortable.

You can either ask the uncomfortable questions now and get the answer today, or not ask and discover the answers later. It's your choice. 

## Don't Ignore the Red Flags

> The perfect person does not exist. Everything is found in degrees of compromise. "Can I live with this, or can I accept that?".

Ask questions of anyone you date and store their answers in your memory bank to see if the answers continue to be consistent with their actions.

- Build a real relationship but stay out of bed
- pray together
    - when couples prayed together on a daily basis, less than 1% of those couples would end up getting a divorce. The numbers were 1 out of 1156. (Source: Faithful Attraction, by Andrew Greeley)

## If you have to talk yourself into it...

Think twice.


## Real Potential

Many couples talk themselves into engagement because they focus on what the other person *could* become, rather than who they are right now.

"The key to a happy relationship is two happy people"--Naval Ravikant

But if you believe in the possibilities of what could be, rather than focusing on what actually is, then the problem is not the other person--it's you!

You cannot change people, you can only accept them as they are, and then, choose to grow or split. It's that simple.

## Every Morning at Breakfast

Please consider the following suggestions:
- If you have mixed feelings about engagement, don't!
- Dating is one thing, life-long commitment is totally separate
- Don't feel pressure from society nor your biological clock
- Identify the non-negotiables in your marriage before engagement, not after
- Don't plan on a marriage fixing your current problems; it only compounds them
- Don't live together before marriage
