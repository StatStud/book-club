# Summary

## One Sentence Summary
while a woman’s behavior can appear irrational for a variety of unknown reasons, showing and telling her that she is loved while being able to reassure her during her emotional storms is what helps keep the marital waters calm.

## One paragraph Summary
I learned that women are often inundated with negative thoughts, and they need lots of two very special ingredients: (1) reassurance (2) pursuit. 

A women can begin behaving negative for a variety of unknown reasons. Sometimes, they don’t even know why they are upset. But reassurance and pursuit are two methods that help at least reduce one of the major motives for “irrational behavior”. 

You see, with all the negative emotions women face, two of the most reoccurring ones are “does he still love me?” And “does he still find me beautiful?”. During these flairs of negative thoughts and emotions, women want their man to pursue them. 

Constant, multi-day pursuit is how you help keep these negative emotions at bay. You pursue your women the same way you won her heart at the beginning, when you two where getting to know each other. Sending messages, words of affirmation, dates, time together, etc. She needs to feel like she is the most special person in the world. You also do this with your eyes, and making sure to illustrate with your eyes that she is the most beautiful women in the world and no other woman is even on the radar. 

None of this is easy, which is where reassurance comes to play. Sometimes, she can be in a bad mood because of her hormones. Reassurance is your attempt at being closer with her and pulling her in when she is upset, rather than doing what most men want and leaving her alone, isolated, with time and space to think. A big key of reassurance is active listening and empathy. These are when you let her talk and you let her “win the battle” because she needs to feel like her emotions are valid and heard--solving these problems by offering solutions does not help.

## What is the foundational knowledge required for me to learn this?
I read this book because my life circumstances led me to wanting to better understand. 
A lot of this will make sense with experience, so there is no particular prior book that I can think of that would be a "required reading".

# What do I hope to learn AND take ACTION on after reading this book?

# What brought you to reading this book? How did you hear about it?
Having been in a relationship with my woman, and being recently married to her, I find that women will sometimes experience these negative episodes, and I want to get to the bottom of how to better handle these volatile events in a way I can understand.

# What are my assumptions before reading this book?
I assumed that women were emotional for no reason. Now, after reading, a lot of why women get upset can actually be pretty logical. Of course, it only makes sense if you have constant communication with your woman and you understand what her expectations are.

# Reading Comprehension questions from ChatGPT

# What ACTIONS/HABITS will I partake after reading this book?
Definitely sending more text messages to my wife throughout the day. The importance of little actions that show that I am thinking about her. As well as the continued assurance that my listening skills are super helpful for her. 

# What Questions do I have after reading this book?
None.

# What Phrase(s) can I add/validate to my mantras?
- The EXACT same way men are constantly thinking about earning more money, women too are constantly thinking of the relationship is going well—if you still love her and would choose her, today 
- “I’m busy right now and I need some space, but I want you to know that we’re okay”
- Men need space, women need hugs 
- “I just want him to come close and give me a hug and let me know that he still loves me”
- “she’s hoping that you will prove that you really do love her by standing your ground, not quitting, and continuing to love her”
- Behavior that confuses or frustrates you signals a need she is asking you to meet, so respond by pursuing and fighting for her

# Notes

## Chapter 1: rethinking random

## Chapter 2: the deal is never closed

One sentence summary: reassurance is how you heal your woman’s insecurities; daily  pursuit is how you prevent them.

One paragraph summary: a woman is in constant need of validation of the love. 

Notes:
- Women are constantly thinking, “would he choose me again?”
- Basically, when your woman is acting strange or annoyed for no reason, that’s often a warning sign that you’re short on your validation
- The EXACT same way men are constantly thinking about earning more money, women too are constantly thinking of the relationship is going well—if you still love her and would choose her, today 
- For women, logic goes out the window. They are looking for a FEELING of love, NOT a logical reasoning on the evidence that supports the probability of the relationship continuing
- Reassurance and pursuit are the two solutions here
- Here is how to reassure:
- Step 1: the magic phrase
    ○ (In the context of marriage conflict, or maybe you have a heavy week at work): “I’m busy right now and I need some space, but I want you to know that we’re okay”
    ○ But here’s the final step to making this magic phrase work: you have to come back and resolve the conflict. “The fact that he comes back often matters more than the reason for the conflict in the first place “I just want him to come close and give me a hug
- Step 2
    ○ Men need space, women need hugs
    ○ As Brandi (from idlewild church) told me, “sometimes, women are upset, and we don’t even know why we are upset!”
    ○ In those cases, “I just want him to come close and give me a hug and let me know that he still loves me”
- Step 3
    ○ Let her talk. Talk, talk, talk.
- Step 4
    ○ If she continues to be difficult, continue to reassure her
    ○ “It’s illogical and irrational, but for many women,  the more unloved she feels, the more likely she is to push you away and intentionally make it hard for you to love her”
    ○ Why does she do this?
    ○ Like in a romantic movie, “she’s hoping that you will prove that you really do love her by standing your ground, not quitting, and continuing to love her”
    ○ Sorry if you were looking for a logical answer. But that’s the truthful answer
- Let’s talk about this idea of women not communicating what they want to hear
    ○ For women, it’s meaningless (to them, but not us logical and rational guys) to ask for their husbands to say cute things. Like she made him say something he did not feel.
    ○ Think about it: if you asked your woman to orgasim, and she fakes it because you asked for some reaction, then it wouldn’t feel real
- Now a few notes of pursuit
    ○ Pursuit is likely to make you a great husband in your wife’s eyes
    ○ Pursuit means doing the things you did at the beginning of your relationship, when you were trying to win her over 
    ○ For women, there is never a permanent proof of love. Just like a car, showing daily love to your woman is like doing the necessary maintenance to your car
    ○ Ask yourself: what did I do when we were dating that made me irresistible?
    ○ Find that set of actions, and do them everyday if you value the long term avoidance of issues down the road

## Chapter 3: Windows…open

One sentence summary: women are biologically wired to always be thinking of something in relation to the question “is our relationship okay?”; make it easy for her by providing her a listening ear and words of reassurance.

One paragraph summary:  

Notes 
- Women are thinking about so many things all the time. Their minds are racing. And they can’t stop it. It’s almost like a mental disorder you have to accept
- A woman’s mind is like having a computer with multiple windows open, for several weeks, and a few malware pop ups that get in the way 
- Unlike men, she is always thinking of something in the back of her head
- “Research shows that a women’s brain is fundamentally different from a man’s brain—and it doesn’t need fixing”
- Even after childbirth, a woman’s brain also changes
- A key reason for all these “windows” in a woman’s brain is the ratio of gray matter to white matter in the corpus callosum superhighway between the hemispheres of the woman’s brain
- Women have more white matter, while men have more grey matter
- This means that woman’s brain are meant to process a lot of things at the same time, while men are designed to work on one thing at a time
- So, this is why the “little things” that she asks you to do matter a lot. They’re on her mind until they are complete
    ○ This means, that if Fabi asks me if I have read my Bible, it’s because it’s that tiny detail that her brain cannot close
- Practical advice 1: her daily (sometimes hourly) mental question is always probing to determine “are we (is the relationship) okay?”
    ○ For Fabi, this means high religious alignment
    ○ Fabi has this belief that, as long as we are following God’s plan, then we are okay, and the relationship is okay
    ○ So, for the relationship to be strong, we need to be strong in our faith, and if her mental question is triggered hourly, then that means she’s looking for these small victories that validate the religious alignment (and hence a prosperous relationship)
    ○ And no, she cannot simply “ignore it” or “turn off” these thoughts—they are part of her female biology
- Practical advice 2: use her pop-up triggers or nagging as an indicator sign to address her needs
    ○ Instead of saying “don’t worry about it, I have it taken care of” simply listen and reassure (which, honestly, is the same vibe as “don’t worry about it”)
    ○ Gold tip: ask how she is doing before going to bed. This is why Fabi and Vale always ask each other about their days and talk all day

## Chapter 4: the reason hiding in her “unreasonable” action

One sentence summary: Behavior that confuses or frustrates you signals a need she is asking you to meet, so respond by pursuing and fighting for her

Notes:
- Behavior that confuses or frustrates you is signals a need she is asking you to meet
- When confronted with behavior, most men will leave their wives alone to calm down, hoping she will get better on her own
- “Women are meant to be loved, not understood”
- Two new truths if you’re truly willing to improve: (1) good reasons exist for a woman’s “irrational” behavior (2) we (men) can discover and act on these reasons, thus making everyone happy
- Four reasons for their irritation behavior:
    ○ (1) it’s something you’ve done, even if you don’t realize you did it. This is when you notice their tone/vine change, when though they say “it’s fine” or “if you want to. In either case, women want you to pursue and fight for her, rather than simply accepting that she’s “fine”
    ○ Respond with something like “I know you say things are fine, but  I think maybe I hurt your feelings just now. Can you help me understand what I did?”
    ○ (2) it’s not necessarily about you, but about a hidden-from-you emotional need inside her. Recall that women are constantly thinking “does he still love me”, and any trigger of that question requires us men to reassure her of our love. If she pulls back, she of hoping you will pursue her. In such cases, assume that your woman troubles with communication, and this is her way of pleading for your reassurance 
    ○ You might think this whole thing is silly and foolish. Join the club pal
    ○ Don’t see it as her playing games, but as her necessarily nonverbal plea for emotional need
    ○ At the very least: don’t withdraw when she withdraws, but ask questions 
    ○ (3) it’s not about you, it’s about her circumstances 
    ○ Some people just have bad days
    ○ Before assuming this option, you first want to ask if you did anything wrong and really try to inquire the cause
    ○ In these cases, it’s best to be the listening hear for her venting and the shoulder on which she can cry
    ○ (4) it’s her hormones/period
    ○  Fabi actually told me to ask if if she is on her days, so it’s perfectly fine to check

## Chapter 5: your real home is closer to home 

One sentence summary: knowing a person, deep down, and the value of intimate relationships is far more important than the things we can buy.

Notes:
- Here is the criteria that women care about
    ○ She feels that the two of you are close
    ○ She sees that you make time together a priority 
    ○ She sees your commitment to her
    ○ She sees that you are active in the life of the home
    ○  She sees you making an effort to provide (assuming the first 4 points above are already in good condition)
- For most women, the currency that matters is not the bank account, but the level of closeness you both have 
- For women, proximity (living together in the same home) and sex do not equal closeness
- Billion-dollar question: what builds closeness? It’s the little things! The small random acts of love each day.
- Closeness means that she feels that you two are best friends, meaning that she feels like she knows you better than anyone else
- She feels secure when you make time together a priority 
- She needs to feel like she comes first, before your job (even though you feel like your job is what shows you care for her) 
- She feels secure when you demonstrate your commitment to her after a conflict or emotionally draining experience. If you show that you don’t leave when shit gets hard, then she’ll feel secure
- She feels secure when you show you are active in parenting and the life of the home. The idea that pure willing to help out even though you’re tired from work because the reality is, she is tired as well
- The last section talks about what it means to be a present father, and it has a few great illustrations. In summary, think back to how papa created moments to be present, and the impact that had on relationships. Be not only a present husband, but father to your children

## Chapter 6: Listening is the solution

One sentence summary: people just need to vent, be heard, and feel like their experience is valid; be that personal diary for your wife.

notes:
- Women are not like men; women don't like having space and prefer to talk things out rather than figuring it out themselves alone. If she seems upset, go to her and be the listening ear. Be her personal diary for her to spill her thoughts out loud
- Listening tells a woman louder than almost anything else that she is known, cared for, and loved.
- Listening is the highest ROI activity you can do to improve your relationship and intimacy
- My own take on this: women need to feel like they are heard and that their own emotional experience in valid. That's all.
- For a woman, her negative feelings about a problem are the real issue; her feelings are what she is trying most to share and have understood, rather than the actual problem
- The rest of the chapter talks about how to listen to people, which I think other books like "how to talk to people" work better. Basically, I already know what works here
- "Yes darling"
- The person who listens well holds enormous power


## Chapter 7: With sex, her "no" doesn't mean you

One sentence summary:  learn to date her again, as if you're trying to win her over from the beginning

Notes:
- TLDR; learn to date her again, as if you're trying to win her over from the beginning. 


## Chapter 8: The girl in the mirror

One sentence summary: your eyes matter, and they can make or break your marriage, so always choose to uplift the beauty of your wife with constant, multi-day affirmations of her beauty.


One paragraph summary: women are not like men. They are more fragile and susceptible to negative emotions. That’s why, whereas men can hear 1 compliment every 10 years, women need to hear that compliment multiple times in a day. Remember that she needs to hear it. She needs to hear she’s beautiful and loved. 

Notes:
- In addition to the reoccurring (ad in, hourly) question of “does he still love me?”, women often ask themselves “does he think I’m still pretty?”
- Pro tip: every four hours (when your watch goes off), include in your check list the last time you told your wife (1) she is loved (2) she looks beautiful 
- Remember: she still needs to hear it.
- She’s not a man who thinks logically or looks at the actions, but a women who needs constant reassurance.
- You, her husband, are her mirror
- As the mirror, everyday you don’t reflect back positive words of affirmation, she negative inner critic takes over and grows stronger, hence leading to negative behavior 
- It also helps to not only schedule these phrases, but to also share them liberally contextually (e.g. when she enters your space physical like “wow she is so hot, I can’t help but notice her”, when she has a new hair style, when she notices an attractive girl on TV, etc)
- Women want to buy new cloths and make up, not to waste money, but because to them that’s what helps their fragile egos make them feel pretty. Accept this 
- If a women see’s her husband’s eyes also affirming the beauty of another woman, she ceases to feel special
- From the female perspective, there is no “it’s just a guy thing”, 
- “I urge you [as a man] not to settle for what many in our culture consider acceptable compromises in this area”
- Look, women don’t want to feel that they can never represent the true beauty you see in younger women…for the sake of your long term sanity, it’s best you give these girls the blue bill. Trust me, you will massively benefit from this as well, worth more than all the world’s gold
- As men, we are called to guard our eyes. Period.
- It’s worth noting here to re-read “every man’s battle”, and then read it again. And again. Until it sticks in your head the real damage and harm your eyes have in your relationship sanity. Believe this. Si o si
- Note to self: each time you watch porn, you are putting your marriage in a losing battle. The only way porn ends is with guaranteed distraction and total loss on your part. You lose 100% of the time 
    


## Chapter 9: The man she hoped to marry

One sentence summary: some words of affirmation for us men.
