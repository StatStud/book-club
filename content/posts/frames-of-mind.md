# Part 1: Background

## The Idea of Multiple Intelligences

### Summary 

Historically, there have been two camps of thought on intelligence: (1) fixed mindset (2) growth mindset.

This book will provide evidence for the existence of several *relatively* **autonomous** human intellectual competences.

This will be accomplished by gaining a new perspective on human cognition and the impact of multiple intelligence on society. 

### Chapter Details

Howard Gardner compares fixed mindset with growth mindset by using a comparison between the hedgehog and the fox.

Gardner chose the hedgehog and fox as a metaphor for two different approaches to thinking and problem-solving because of a fable by the ancient Greek poet Archilochus. In the fable, the fox, who is cunning and adaptable, is able to avoid the hedgehog, who is single-minded and focused on his defense mechanism of rolling up into a spiny ball. This fable illustrates the idea that there are different ways of approaching a problem or situation.

In "Frames of Mind," Gardner uses this fable to explain that the hedgehog represents a fixed mindset that is focused on one idea or theory, and is not open to alternative perspectives or new information. The hedgehog's spines represent the hedgehog's resistance to change or to considering alternative perspectives. The fox, on the other hand, represents an open-minded approach that is willing to consider many different perspectives and adapt to new information. The fox's ability to outsmart the hedgehog represents the idea that adaptability and flexibility are important for effective problem-solving.

In summary, Gardner chose the hedgehog and fox metaphor to illustrate two different ways of thinking and problem-solving. The hedgehog represents a fixed mindset, while the fox represents an open-minded approach. The metaphor emphasizes the importance of being flexible and adaptable in one's thinking to effectively navigate complex problems and situations.

Gardner's key argument is for the existence of several *relatively* **autonomous** human intellectual competences, which he calls the "frames of mind".

These intelligences are relatively independent of on another, and they can be fashioned and combined in a multiplicity of adaptive ways by individuals and cultures.

Gardner provides a four step approach to illustrating his following theory:
1. Expand the perspective on cognitive and development psychology through two avenues
    - biological and evolutionary roots of cognition
    - cultural variations in cognitive competence
2. Discuss the educational implications of the multiple intelligence theory
    - every person should have an identifiable intellectual profile that can be used to enhance such person's educational opportunities 
3. Inspire anthropologists to study how intelligence profiles may be fostered in various cultural environments
4. Encourage policy makers to help improve eduction to accommodate multiple intelligence types
