## Preface
- At first, I taught only public speaking, but, as the years went by, I saw that these adults also needed the ability to win friends and influence people. Since I couldn't find an adequate textbook on human relations, I wrote one myself. I called it How to Win Friends and Influence People.
- Almost nine times as many books about worms as about worry!
- As far as I know, it is the first and only laboratory of its kind in the world. This is what we did. We gave students a set of rules on how to stop worrying and asked them to apply these rules in their own lives and then talk to the class on the results they had obtained. So this book didn't come out of an ivory tower
- One thing is certain: this book is practical
- when it comes to that, you and I don't need to be told anything new. We already know enough to lead perfect lives. We have all read the golden rule and the Sermon on the Mount. Our trouble is not ignorance, but inaction. The purpose of this book is to restate, illustrate, streamline, air-condition, and glorify a lot of ancient and basic truths-and kick you in the shins and make you do something about applying them
- You are looking for action. All right, let's go.

## Part One - Fundamental Facts You Should Know About Worry

### Chapter 1 - Live in "Day-tight Compartments"
Chapter 1 Summary: The best possible way to prepare for tomorrow is to concentrate with all your intelligence, all your enthusiasm, on doing today's work superbly today. That is the only possible way you can prepare for the future. One grain of sand at a time. One task at a time. So let's be content to live the only time we can possibly live: from now until bedtime

- The twenty-one words that this young medical student read in 1871 helped him to become the most famous physician of his generation
- His name was Sir William Osier. Here are the twenty-one words that he read in the spring of 1871- twenty-one words from Thomas Carlyle that helped him lead a life free from worry: "Our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand."
- What, then, was the secret of his success? He stated that it was owing to what he called living in "day- tight compartments."
- “Touch another and shut off, with a metal curtain, the Future -the unborn tomorrows. Then you are safe-safe for today! ... Shut off the past! Let the dead past bury its dead. ... Shut out the yesterdays which have lighted fools the way to dusty death. ... The load of tomorrow, added to that of yesterday, carried today, makes the strongest falter. Shut off the future as tightly as the past. ... The future is today. ... There is no tomorrow”
- Did Dr. Osier mean to say that we should not make any effort to prepare for tomorrow? No. Not at all.
- The best possible way to prepare for tomorrow is to concentrate with all your intelligence, all your enthusiasm, on doing today's work superbly today. That is the only possible way you can prepare for the future.
- Sir William Osier urged the students at Yale to begin the day with Christ's prayer: "Give us this day our daily bread."
- Remember that that prayer asks only for today's bread
- The famous sermon on the mount: “Take therefore no thought for the morrow; for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."  
- By all means take thought for the tomorrow, yes, careful thought and planning and preparation. But have no anxiety.
- the chief difference between good thinking and bad thinking is this: good thinking deals with causes and effects and leads to logical, constructive planning; bad thinking frequently leads to tension and nervous breakdowns
- think of your life as an hourglass: Nothing you or I could do would make more than one grain of sand pass through this narrow neck without impairing the hourglass. if we do not take them one at a time and let them pass through the day slowly and evenly, then we are bound to break our own physical or mental structure
- One grain of sand at a time. One task at a time.
- One of the most appalling comments on our present way of life is that half of all the beds in our hospitals are reserved for patients with nervous and mental troubles, patients who have collapsed under the crushing burden of accumulated yesterdays and fearful tomorrows. Yet a vast majority of those people would be walking the streets today, leading happy, useful lives, if they had only heeded the words of Jesus: "Have no anxiety about the morrow"; or the words of Sir William Osier: "Live in day-tight compartments."
- So let's be content to live the only time we can possibly live: from now until bedtime.
- Every day is a new life to a wise man.
- One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living. We are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon-instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today.
- somehow he has missed it all, and it is gone. Life, we learn too late, is in the living, in the tissue of every day and hour.
- “You cannot step in the same river twice." The river changes every second; and so does the man who stepped in it. Life is a ceaseless change. The only certainty is today. Why mar the beauty of living today by trying to solve the problems of a future that is shrouded in ceaseless change and uncertainty-a future that no one can possibly foretell

### Chapter 2 - A Magic Formula For Solving Worry Situations

Chapter 2 summary: worry hinders your ability to concentrate. If you find yourself worrying, consider the fear-setting exercise: (1) ask what is the worst case (2) think of ways to prevent or reduce probability of worst case (3) ask how you can fix it if worst case happens (4) consider the price of inaction. "I can trace all of my biggest wins and all of my biggest disasters averted back to doing fear-setting", Tim Ferris.

- Simple, 3-step technique to handle worry: 
    ○ (1) analyze the situation fearlessly and honestly and figure out what is the worst that could possibly happen as a result of failure 
    ○ (2) accepting it, let go, and move on 
    ○ (3) devoted your time and energy to trying to improve upon the worst
- (In relation to a recent success) “I probably would never have been able to do this if I had kept on worrying”
- because one of the worst features about worrying is that it destroys our ability to concentrate
- Lin Yutang in his widely read book, The Importance of Living.
- That's it, exactly! Psychologically, it means a new release of energy! When we have accepted the worst, we have nothing more to lose. And that automatically means-we have everything to gain! "After facing the worst," Willis H. Carrier reported, "I immediately relaxed and felt a sense of peace that I hadn't experienced in days. From that time on, I was able to think.
- Otherwise we end up as victims of that brooding fixation known as melancholia.
- “Well, with my business ruined, I would probably have to look for a job. That wasn't bad. I knew a lot about oil- there were several firms that might be glad to employ me. ... I began to feel better. The blue funk I had been in for three days and nights began to lift a little. My emotions calmed down. ... And to my astonishment, I was able to think
- Well, the next morning my lawyer told me to go and see the District Attorney and tell him the truth…This blackmail racket had been going on for months and that the man who claimed to be a 'government agent' was a crook wanted by the police. What a relief to hear all this after I had tormented myself for three days and nights wondering whether I should hand over five thousand dollars to this professional swindler!
    ○ The truth shall set you free
    ○ Just like my anxiety with seeing Fabi
    ○ Speaking the truth has profound healing powers
- So, Rule 2 is: If you have a worry problem, apply the magic formula of Willis H. Carrier by doing these three things-
    ○ Ask yourself,' 'What is the worst that can possibly happen?"
    ○ Accept it, if you have to
    ○ Ameliorate on the worst.

- I personally like Tim Ferriss' "What if I..." diagram shown below (from [his Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J6jAC6XxAI), "Why you should define your fears instead of your goals")

![](/what-if-i-chart.png)

- To use this chart, simply list on the right side whatever is causing you fear, anxiety, doubt, etc.
- In addition to defining your fear, write down between 10-20 resulting scenarios (worst-case scenarios) that could happen with your fear
- In the "Prevent column", you write down what you can do to prevent (or even reduce the probability of occurrence) each of the listed 10-20 worst-case scenarios from happening
- In the "Repair" column, what can you do to repair the damage from the worst-case scenario, even a little bit. How many people have handled this in the past?
- Then, after completing the chart, answer this question: "What might be the benefits of an attempt, or partial success?"
- Spend 10-15 minutes on this, and really think about other non-tangible benefits such as confidence, learning, or relationships

![](/cost-of-inaction-chart.png)

- Finally, consider the cost of inaction. 
> "I can trace all of my biggest wins and all of my biggest disasters averted back to doing fear-setting once a quarter" - (Tim Ferris, minute 10:12 from linked Ted Talk)

### Chapter 3: What Worry May Do To You
    - Some time ago, a neighbour rang my doorbell one evening and urged me and my family to be vaccinated against smallpox. The cause of all this excitement? Eight people in New York City had smallpox-and two had died. Two deaths out of a population of almost eight million
    - Nobel prizewinner in medicine, Dr. Alexis Carrel, said: "Business men who do not know how to fight worry die young." 
    - Dr. O. F. Goberone, chief physician of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Hospital Association, “70% of all patients who come to physicians could cure themselves if they only got rid of their fears and worries
    - Dr. Joseph F. Montague, author of the book Nervous Stomach Trouble, says much the same thing. He says: "You do not get stomach ulcers from what you eat. You get ulcers from what is eating you."
    - Dr. W.C. Alvarez, of the Mayo Clinic, said "Ulcers frequently flare up or subside according to the hills and valleys of emotional stress."
    - That statement was backed up by a study of 15,000 patients treated for stomach disorders at the Mayo Clinic. Four out of five had no physical basis whatever for their stomach illnesses. 
    - Fear, worry, hate, supreme selfishness, and the inability to adjust themselves to the world of reality-these were largely the causes of their stomach illnesses and stomach ulcers. ... Stomach ulcers can kill you. According to Life magazine, they now stand tenth in our list of fatal diseases.
    - The famous Mayo brothers declared that more than half of our hospital beds are occupied by people with nervous troubles
    - Their "nervous troubles" are caused not by a physical deterioration of the nerves, but by emotions of futility, frustration, anxiety, worry, fear, defeat, despair
    - Another illuminating book about worry is lion Against Himself, by Dr. Karl Menninger, one of the "Mayo brothers of psychiatry."
        ○ Read it. Give it to your friends. It costs four dollars-and is one of the best investments you can make in this life
    - (In relation to another story, General Grant of the civil war) The next morning, he was cured instantaneously. And the tiling that cured him was not a mustard plaster, but a horseman galloping down the road with a letter from Lee, saying he wanted to surrender."When the officer [bearing the message] reached me," Grant wrote, "I was still suffering with the sick headache, but the instant I saw the contents of the note, I was cured
        ○ Obviously it was Grant's worries, tensions, and emotions that made him ill. He was cured instantly the moment his emotions took on the hue of confidence, achievement, and victory
        ○ What if we remember the victory that Christ already has for us?
    - Relaxation and Recreation: The most relaxing recreating forces are a healthy religion, sleep, music, and laughter.Have faith in God-learn to sleep well-Love good music-see the funny side of life- And health and happiness will be yours.
    - Here is a startling and almost incredible fact: more Americans commit suicide each year than die from the five most common communicable diseases. Why? The answer is largely: "Worry."
    - quoting Dr. Alexis Carrel again. He said: "Those who keep the peace of their inner selves in the midst of the tumult of the modern city are immune from nervous diseases."
        ○ Similar to Rollo May’s quote: “A single person with indigenous inner strength exercises a great calming effect on panic among people around him” 

That concludes part 1 of this text. Here are the 3 main rules to remember:
    - If you want to avoid worry, live each day until bedtime
    - If you find yourself worrying, remember the triple A: (1) Ask yourself what is the worst possible case (2) accept the worst possible case (3) Ameliorate upon the worst case
    - Remember the price you pay if you decide to worry (your health)

 Part Two - Basic Techniques In Analyzing Worry

Chapter 4 - How To Analyze And Solve Worry Problems

    - “Half the worry in the world is caused by people trying to make decisions before they have sufficient knowledge on which to base a decision”, Herbert E. Hawkes, Dean of Columbia College, Columbia University 
        ○ “if a man will devote his time to securing facts in an impartial, objective way, his worries usually evaporate in the light of knowledge.”
        ○ We have to keep our emotions out of our thinking
    - That is not an easy task when we are worried. When we are worried, our emotions are riding high. But here are two ideas that I have found helpful when trying to step aside from my problems, in order to see the facts in a clear, objective manner.
        ○ When trying to get the facts, I pretend that I am collecting this information not for myself, but for some other person.
            § This helps me to take a cold, impartial view of the evidence. 
            § This helps me eliminate my emotions
        ○ pretend that I am a lawyer preparing to argue the other side of the issue. In other words, I try to get all the facts against myself-all the facts that are damaging to my wishes, all the facts I don't like to face
            § Then I write down both my side of the case and the other side of the case-(a pros and cons list) and I generally find that the truth lies somewhere in between these two extremities
    - So Rule 1 for solving our problems is: Get the facts
    - It also comes down to asking: what’s am I going to do about it?
    - Side note: from my own personal experience: planning the week ahead gives me immense relief. The same goals here: write a plan, write the sequences, and then do it
    - 4 practical template questions to answer (ANSWER THESE WITH A PEN & PAPER)
        a. What am I worried about?
        b. What can I do about it?
        c. What is the path that I will take?
        d. When am I going to start?

Chapter 5 - How to Eliminate Fifty Per Cent of Tour Business Worries
    - Ask these 4 questions in order to dissect issues:
        ○ What is the problem?
        ○ What is the root cause of the problem
        ○ What are all possible solutions to the problem?
        ○ What solution do you suggest?
    - “My associates rarely come up to me with their problems because they have discovered that, in order to answer these four questions, they have to get all the facts first and think through clearly”
    - Example of man who discovered 80/20 principle, and cured his depresor work 
    
    
Part two summary:
    - Part two is all about the 5 rules to ask to instantly eliminate worry.
    - 5 questions to answer in order to get the facts and reduce worry in light of knowledge:
        ○ What exactly is the problem?
        ○ What is the root cause of the problem?
        ○ What can I do about it? What are some possible solutions?
        ○ From the list of possible solutions, what action will I take?
        ○ When will I take action? (Hint: now!)
    - Other points to remember:
        ○ An intimate desire to learn, curiosity, to transcend your worry is the magic ingredient
        ○ “I find that I have to keep going back over what I read in order to fully understand what I read”


Summary by chapter:
        ○ Chapter 1: live  from now until bedtime. One day at a time. 
        ○ Chapter 2: to reduce worry, think AAA: (1) Ask, “what’s the worst that could happen?”(2) Accept the worst case scenario (3) Ameliorate upon the worst case, and go from there
        ○ Chapter 3: Remember the price you pay if you decide to worry (your health). Dr. O. F. Goberone, chief physician of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Hospital Association, “70% of all patients who come to physicians could cure themselves if they only got rid of their fears and worries. Dr. Alexis Carrel, said: "Business men who do not know how to fight worry die young."
        ○ Chapter 4: Rule 1 for solving our problems is: Get the facts.
        ○ Chapter 5: questions to ask to aid from previous chapter. (1) what is the issue at hand? (2) what is the root cause of the issue? (3) what are some ideas to overcome the issue? (4) which possible solution will I choose? (5) when will I start? (Hint: now)
    
Summary by parts of the book:
    - Part 1: Overview of worry, the price of worry on your health, and an intro technique for analyzing your worry
    - Part 2: the 5 questions to instantly eliminate your worry


Part 3: how to break the worry habit before it breaks you

Chapter 6: how to crowd worry out of tour mind
    - It is difficult to worry when while you are busy doing something that  requires planning and thinking
        ○ I am so busy, I have no time for worry!
    - Luis Pasteur once spoke on the “peace that is found in libraries and  laboratories”
    - So, why does such a simple thing as keeping busy help prevent worry?
        ○ Because of this fundamental law of the mind: the mind can only think on one think at a time
    -  “Occupational therapy” is the term now used in psychiatry when work is prescribed as though it were medicine. But this has always been an ancient technique used by people
    - The devil loves idle hands
    - TLDR; get occupied with something constructive 
    - Osa Johnson and her book, “I married adventure”, is a great book
    - “I must close myself in action”
    - This is the same advice from Pieter Level’s dad “if you feel down, grab a shovel and start digging”
    - Rule #1: Keep busy. The worried person must lose himself in action, lest be wither in despair

Chapter 7: don’t let the beetles get you down
    -  “I learned more about the art of living in those fifteen terrible hours in that submarine than I had learned by studying books for four years in Syracuse University.”
    - Imagine somehow  surviving the rare storms and avalanches and lightning blasts, only to let our hearts be eaten out by little beetles of worry-little beetles that could be crushed between a finger and a thumb
    - In other words, don’t lose sleep over your preferences. Preferences are just that-preferences 
    - Rule #2: Let's not allow ourselves to be upset by small things we should despise and forget. Remember "Life is too short to be little."

Chapter 8: a law that will outlaw 
    - As I grew older, I realized that 99% of the things I worried about never happened
    - If you understand statistics, then you have nothing to worry about 
    - Insurance companies earn millions based on fear 
    - “Have you ever been troubled by worry?”, “troubled by it? My life was almost ruined by it” 
    - We suffer more in imagination than in reality
    - how many fruit cars have you handled over the years?' The answer was: 'About twenty-five thousand.' Then I asked myself: 'How many of those cars were ever wrecked?' The answer was: 'Oh-maybe five.' Then I said to myself: 'Only five-out of twenty-five thousand? Do you know what that means? A ratio of five thousand to one! In other words, by the law of averages, based on experience, the chances are five thousand to one against one of your cars ever being wrecked. So what are you worried about?'Then I said to myself: 'Well, a bridge may collapse!' Then I asked myself: 'How many cars have you actually lost from a bridge collapsing?' The answer was-'None.' Then I said to myself: 'Aren't you a fool to be worrying yourself into stomach ulcers over a bridge which has never yet collapsed, and over a railroad wreck when the chances are five thousand to one against it!'
    - I was almost a nervous wreck. I knew that if I didn't do something, I would go stark crazy. So I reminded myself that five nights had passed, and I was still alive; and so was every man in our outfit
    - Rule #3: “Let's examine the record." Let's ask ourselves: "What are the chances, according to the law of averages, that this event I am worrying about will ever occur?"

Chapter 9 - Co-Operate With The Inevitable (page 52) 
    - It is astonishing how quickly we can accept almost any situation-if we have to-and adjust ourselves to it and forget about it.
    - “It is so. It cannot be otherwise.”
    - William James. "Be willing to have it so,"
    - Obviously, circumstances alone do not make us happy or unhappy. It is the way we react to circumstances that determines our feelings. 
    - Jesus said that the kingdom of heaven is within you. That is where the kingdom of hell is, too
    - We can all endure disaster and tragedy and triumph over them-if we have to. We may not think we can, but we have surprisingly strong inner resources that will see us through if we will only make use of them. We are stronger than we think.
    - It is not miserable to be blind, it is only miserable not to be able to endure blindness
    - Am I advocating that we simply bow down to all the adversities that come our way? Not by a long shot! As long as there is a chance that we can save a situation, let's fight!
    - But when common sense tells us that we are up against something that is so-and cannot be otherwise- then, in the name of our sanity, let's not look before and after and pine for what is not
    - There is only one way to happiness," Epictetus taught the Romans, "and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will."
    - Like tires on a car, You and I will last longer, and enjoy smoother riding, if we learn to absorb the shocks and jolts along the rocky road of life.
    - This priceless prayer was written by Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr, Professor of Applied Christianity, Union Theological Seminary, Broadway and 120th Street, New York.
    God grant me the serenity To accept the things I cannot change; The courage to change the things I can; And the wisdom to know the difference.
    - Rule 4: Co-operate with the inevitable


Chapter 10 - Put A " Stop-Loss" Order On Your Worries (pg 58) 
    - I wish I had had the sense, years ago, to put stop-loss orders on my impatience, on my temper, on my desire for self-justification, on my regrets, and on all my mental and emotional strains. 
    - Why didn't I have the horse sense to size up each situation that threatened to destroy my peace of mind and say to myself: "See here, Dale Carnegie, this situation is worth just so much fussing about and no more"? ... Why didn't I?
    - “In short, I conceive that a great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whistles.” Ben Franklin
    -  All to what end? Why did these two people turn the only home they had into what Tolstoy himself called "a lunatic asylum"? Obviously, there were several reasons. One of those reasons was their burning desire to impress you and me. Yes, we are the posterity whose opinion they were worried about! Do we give a hoot in Hades about which one was to blame? No, we are too concerned with our own problems to waste a minute thinking about the Tolstoy's. What a price these two wretched people paid for their whistle! Fifty years of living in a veritable hell-just because neither of them had the sense to say: "Stop!" Because neither of them had enough judgment of values to say: "Let's put a stop- loss order on this thing instantly. We are squandering our lives. Let's say 'Enough' now!
    - Yes, I honestly believe that this is one of the greatest secrets to true peace of mind-a decent sense of values. And I believe we could annihilate fifty per cent of all our worries at once if we would develop a sort of private gold standard-a gold standard of what things are worth to us in terms of our lives.
    - Rule 5: Whenever we are tempted to throw good money after bad in terms of human living, let's stop and ask ourselves these three Questions:
        ○ How much does this thing I am worrying about really matter to me?
        ○ At what point shall I set a "stop-loss" order on this worry -and forget it?
        ○ Exactly how much shall I pay for this whistle? Have I already paid more than it is worth?
        
Chapter 11 - Don't Try To Saw Sawdust (pg 62)
    - [in regard to million-year fossiles] Even a Mongolian idiot wouldn't dream of trying to go back 180 million years to change those tracks. Yet that would not be any more foolish than worrying
    - we can't go back and change what happened 180 seconds ago-and a lot of us are doing just that 
    - To be sure, we may do something to modify the effects of what happened 180 seconds ago; but we can't possibly change the event that occurred then.
    - He wiped the loss out of his mind so completely that he never mentioned it again.
    - Here is the second thing I should have done: I should have analysed my mistakes and learned a lasting lesson.
    - But frankly, I didn't do either one of these things. Instead, I went into a tailspin of worry. It was easier to teach 20 people can to teach myself (this is the Solomon’s paradox)
    - Rule 6: the past is the past. Rather than trying to change it, continue on with life
    - Pg 66

Part 3 summary: how to break the worry habit 
    1. Rule 1: Keep busy like Pieter Level’s shovel. The worried person must lose himself in action, lest be wither in despair
    2. Rule 2: Let's not allow ourselves to be upset by small things we should despise and forget. Don’t lose sleep over your preferences. Preferences are just that-preferences
    3. Rule 3: remember statistics. Remember the law of averages: "What are the chances, according to the law of averages, that this event I am worrying about will ever occur?" We suffer more in imagination by thinking about imaginary scenarios, rather than in reality
    4. Rule 4:  Co-operate with the inevitable/reality. It is the way we react to circumstances that determines our feeling
    5. Rule 5: Put A " Stop-Loss" Order On Your Worries.  Have I already paid more than it is worth?
    6. Rule 6: the past is unchangeable. Do your best and forget the rest

Part Four - Seven Ways To Cultivate A Mental Attitude That Will Bring You Peace And Happiness 

 Chapter 12: Eight Words That Can Transform Your Life (pg. 67)
    - by far the most vital lesson I have ever learned is the importance of what we think. 
        ○  If I knew what you think, I would know what you are. Our thoughts make us what we are
        ○ Our mental attitude is the X factor that determines our fate. Emerson said: "A man is what he thinks about all day long." ... How could he possibly be anything else?
        ○ Note: this assumes that we are our thoughts, which many philosophers and spiritual leaders would disagree
    - I now know with a conviction beyond all doubt that the biggest problem you and I have to deal with-in fact, almost the only problem we have to deal with-is choosing the right thoughts
    - I am advocating that we assume a positive attitude instead of a negative attitude
    - In other words, we need to be concerned about our problems, but not worried
        ○ Concern means realising what the problems are and calmly taking steps to meet them. 
        ○ Worrying means going around in maddening, futile circles.
        ○ Let me illustrate. Every time I cross the traffic-jammed streets of New York, I am concerned about what I am doing-but not worried
    - even when Lowell Thomas was facing huge debts and severe disappointments, he was concerned, but not worried
    - British psychiatrist, J. A. Hadfield, gives a striking illustration of that fact in his splendid book, The Psychology of Power
        ○ When their minds were filled with positive thoughts of strength, they increased their actual physical powers almost five hundred per cent
    - you took with you the one thing that is the cause of all your trouble, that is, yourself. There is nothing wrong with either your body or your mind. It is not the situations you have met that have thrown you; it is what you think of these situations. "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he."
    - here I was, wanting to change the whole world and everyone in it- when the only thing that needed changing was the focus of the lens of the camera which was my mind.
    - He who conquers his spirit is mightier than he who taketh a city (Proverbs 16:32)
    -  When moments of uneasiness try to creep in (as they will in everyone's life) I tell myself to get that camera back in focus, and everything is O.K. (Pg. 71)
    - Dad was right when he said it wasn't outward situations that had caused all my suffering, but what I thought of those situations
    - I am deeply convinced that our peace of mind and the joy we get out of living depends not on where we are, or what we have, or who we are, but solely upon our mental attitude
    - A man is not hurt so much by what happens, as by his opinion of what happens. Montaigne, the great French philosopher
    - William James, who has never been topped in his knowledge of practical psychology, once made this observation: "Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not."
        ○ In other words, William James tells us that we cannot instantly change our emotions just by "making up our minds to"-but that we can change our actions. And that when we change our actions, we will automatically change our feelings.
        ○ “Thus," he explains, "The sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if your cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there."
        ○ This is exactly what Layla hormozi mentioned once 
    - Let me ask you a question: If merely acting cheerful and thinking positive thoughts of health and courage can save this man's life, why should you and I even tolerate for one minute more our minor glooms and depressions? It makes no sense
    - Note to self: review the last numbered bullet points of this chapter—it’s good stuff!

Chapter 13: The High Cost Of Getting Even (pg 75)
    - Even if we can't love our enemies, let's at least love ourselves. Let's love ourselves so much that we won't permit our enemies to control our happiness, our health and our looks.
    - “Wait a minute, now. How do I know this man isn't right? This man has possibly done me a favour, even though he didn't mean to. The mere fact that he expressed himself in disagreeable terms doesn't alter my debt to him. Therefore, I am going to write him and thank him for what he has done.”
        ○ Within a few days, George Rona got a letter from this man, asking Rona to come to see him. Rona went-and got a job. George Rona discovered for himself that "a soft answer turneth away wrath".
        ○ THB: this is a really good example of that Proverbs verse
    - No one can humiliate or disturb you and me, either-unless we let him.
    - "I realise that patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness toward anyone." Edith Cavell
    - One sure way to forgive and forget our enemies is to become absorbed in some cause infinitely bigger than ourselves
    - When Laurence Jones was asked afterward if he didn't hate the men who had dragged him up the road to hang him and burn him, he replied that he was too busy with his cause to hate-too absorbed in something bigger than himself. "I have no time to quarrel,"
    - Epictetus pointed out nineteen centuries ago that we reap what we sow and that somehow fate almost always makes us pay for our malefactions. "In the long run," said Epictetus, "every man will pay the penalty for his own misdeeds. The man who remembers this will be angry with no one, indignant with no one, revile no one, blame no one, offend no one, hate no one."
    - Lincoln believed, according to Herndon, his law partner, that "No man was to be eulogised for what he did; or censured for what he did or did not do," because "all of us are the children of conditions, of circumstances, of environment, of education, of acquired habits and of heredity moulding men as they are and will for ever be."
    - Rule 2: Let's never try to get even with our enemies, because if we do we will hurt ourselves far more than we hurt them. Let's do as General Eisenhower does: let's never waste a minute thinking about people we don't like.

Chapter 14: If You Do This, You Will Never Worry About Ingratitude (pg 80)
    - Preface: without even reading the chapter, I know this is something I need. Especially when I help Kevin out, I realize that I often expect something back
    - Instead of wallowing in resentment and self-pity, he might have asked himself why he didn't get any appreciation. Maybe he had underpaid and overworked his employees
        ○ Maybe this. Maybe that. I don't know any more about it than you do. 
        ○ But I do know what Dr. Samuel Johnson said: "Gratitude is a fruit of great cultivation. You do not find it among gross people."
        ○ Here is the point I am trying to make: this man made the human and distressing mistake of expecting gratitude. He just didn't know human nature.
    - Christ healed ten lepers in one afternoon-but how many of those lepers even stopped to thank Him? Only one.
    - Why should you and I-or this business man in Texas-expect more thanks for our small favours than was given Jesus Christ?
    - And when it comes to money matters! Well, that is even more hopeless.
    - If you gave one of your relatives a million dollars, would you expect him to be grateful? Andrew Carnegie did just that. But if Andrew Carnegie had come back from the grave a little while later, he would have been shocked to find this relative cursing him! Why? Because Old Andy had left 365 million dollars to public charities-and had "cut him off with one measly million," as he put it.
    - That's how it goes. Human nature has always been human nature-and it probably won't change in your lifetime. So why not accept it? Why not be as realistic about it?
    - I am going to meet people today who talk too much-people who are selfish, egotistical, ungrateful. But I won't be surprised or disturbed, for I couldn't imagine a world without such people." Marcus Aurelius
    - If you and I go around grumbling about ingratitude, who is to blame? 
        ○ Is it human nature-or is it our ignorance of human nature? 
        ○ Let's not expect gratitude. 
        ○ Then, if we get some occasionally, it will come as a delightful surprise. If we don't get it, we won't be disturbed.
    - It is natural for people to forget to be grateful; so, if we go around expecting gratitude, we are headed straight for a lot of unnecessary heartaches
    - The ideal man," said Aristotle, "takes joy in doing favours for others; but he feels ashamed to have others do favours for him. For it is a mark of superiority to confer a kindness; but it is a mark of inferiority to receive it."
    - Here is the second point I am trying to make in this chapter: If we want to find happiness, let's stop thinking about gratitude or ingratitude and give for the inner joy of giving.
    - Rule 3
        ○ Instead of worrying about ingratitude, let's expect it. Let's remember that Jesus healed ten lepers in one day-and only one thanked Him. Why should we expect more gratitude than Jesus got?
        ○ Let's remember that the only way to find happiness is not to expect gratitude, but to give for the joy of giving.
        ○ Let's remember that gratitude is a "cultivated" trait; so if we want our children to be grateful, we must train them to be grateful.

Chapter 15: Would You Take A Million Dollars For What You Have? (Pg 84)
    - The biggest lesson I learned from that experience," he said, "was that if you have all the fresh water you want to drink and all the food you want to eat, you ought never to complain about anything."
    - About ninety per cent of the things in our lives are right and about ten per cent are wrong. If we want to be happy, all we have to do is to concentrate on the ninety per cent that are right and ignore the ten per cent that are wrong.
    - Would you sell both your eyes for a billion dollars? What would you take for your two legs? Your hands? Your hearing? Your children? Your family? Add up your assets, and you will find that you won't sell what you have for all the gold ever amassed by the Rockefellers, the Fords and the Morgans combined.
        ○ But do we appreciate all this? No!
    - Boy, how I wish I were in your shoes I Look at me. I've got only one arm, and half of my face is shot away, and yet I am not complaining. If you don't stop your growling and grumbling, you will lose not only your business, but also your health, your home, and your friends!
    - This is just like what Earl Nightgale said, those who lose tend to keep on losing. But the opposite is also true: those who win keep on winning
    - “I am ashamed to realise that I never really learned to live until I feared I was going to die."
    - read an inspiring book of incredible courage by Borghild Dahl. It is called I Wanted to See
    - read an inspiring book of incredible courage by Borghild Dahl. It is called I Wanted to See
    - Rule 4 is: Count your blessings-not your troubles!

Chapter 16 - Find Yourself And Be Yourself: Remember There Is No One Else on Earth Like You (pg. 88)
    - “Just be yourself, no matter what they say”
    - there was only one chance in 300,000 billion that the person who is specifically you would be born. (You and Heredity, by Amran Scheinfeld)
    - This time I said to myself: "You've got to be Dale Carnegie, with all his faults and limitations. You can't possibly be anybody else." So I quit trying to be a combination of other men, and rolled up my sleeves and did what I should have done in the first place: I wrote a textbook on public speaking out of my own experiences, observations, and convictions as a speaker and a teacher of speaking.
    - "I can't write a book commensurate with Shakespeare," he said, "but I can write a book by me."
    - Rule 5: Let's not imitate others. Let's find ourselves and be ourselves.

Chapter 17: If You Have A Lemon, Make A Lemonade (pg 93)
    - Two men looked out from prison bars, One saw the mud, the other saw stars.
    - Reason one: we have everything to gain and nothing to lose. We may succeed.
    - Reason two: Even if we don't succeed, the mere attempt to turn our minus into a plus will cause us to look forward instead of backward; it will replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts; it will release creative energy and spur us to get so busy that we won't have either the time or the inclination to mourn over what is past and for ever gone.
    - The north wind made the Vikings
    - Rule 6: When fate hands us a lemon, let's try to make a lemonade.

Chapter 18: How To Cure Melancholy In Fourteen Days (pg 97)
    -  It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow man who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.
    - Dr. Adler urges us to do a good deed every day
    - Why will doing a good deed every day produce such astounding efforts on the doer? Because trying to please others will cause us to stop thinking of ourselves: the very thing that produces worry and fear and melancholia.
    - A third of the people who rush to psychiatrists for help could probably cure themselves if they would only do as Margaret Yates did: get interested in helping others.
        ○ that is approximately what Carl Jung said
        ○ “About one-third of my patients are suffering from no clinically definable neurosis, but from the senselessness and emptiness of their lives.”
    - What about the grocery boy, the newspaper vendor, the chap at the corner who polishes your shoes? These people are human -bursting with troubles, and dreams, and private ambitions
    - But do you ever let them? Do you ever show an eager, honest interest in them or their lives?
    - You don't have to become a Florence Nightingale or a social reformer to help improve the world-your own private world; you can start tomorrow morning with the people you meet!
    - writes Henry C. Link, director of the Psychological Service Centre in New York, "no discovery of modern psychology is, in my opinion, so important as its scientific proof of the necessity of self-sacrifice or discipline to self-realisation and happiness."
    - Thinking of others will not only keep you from worrying about yourself; it will also help you to make a lot of friends and have a lot of fun
    - I find that taking an interest in people makes them beam with pleasure
    - all the great philosophers and teachers since the beginning of recorded history-Jesus, Confucius, Buddha, Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Saint Francis-have agreed on this thing
    - Rule 7: Forget yourself by becoming interested in others. Do every day a good deed that will put a smile of joy on someone's face.

Part Four In A Nutshell - Seven Ways To Cultivate A Mental Attitude That Will Bring You Peace And Happiness

RULE 1: Let's fill our minds with thoughts of peace, courage, health, and hope, for ' 'our life is what our thoughts make it".
RULE 2: Let's never try to get even with our enemies, because if we do we will hurt ourselves far more than we hurt them. Let's do as General Eisenhower does: let's never waste a minute thinking about people we don't like.
RULE 3: A. Instead of worrying about ingratitude, let's expect it. Let's remember that Jesus healed ten lepers in one day-and only one thanked Him. Why should we expect more gratitude than Jesus got?
B. Let's remember that the only way to find happiness is not to expect gratitude-but to give for the joy of giving.
C. Let's remember that gratitude is a "cultivated" trait; so if we want our children to be grateful, we must train them to be grateful.
RULE 4: Count your blessings-not your troubles!
RULE 5: Let's not imitate others. Let's find ourselves and be ourselves, for "envy is ignorance" and "imitation is suicide".
RULE 6: When fate hands us a lemon, let's try to make a lemonade.
RULE 7: Let's forget our own unhappiness-by trying to create a little happiness for others. "When you are good to others, you are best to yourself.

Part Five - The Golden Rule For Conquering Worry

Chapter 19 - How My Mother And Father Conquered Worry (pg 107)
    - Years later, Father told me that the only reason he didn't jump was because of my mother's deep, abiding, and joyous belief that if we loved God and kept His commandments everything would come out all right. Mother was right. Everything did come out all right in the end. Father lived forty-two happy years longer
    - During all those years of struggle and heartache, my mother never worried. She took all her troubles to God in prayer.
    - When William James was professor of philosophy at Harvard, he said: "Of course, the sovereign cure for worry is religious faith."
    - You don't have to go to Harvard to discover that. My mother found that out on a Missouri farm.
    - I didn't know what to believe. I saw no purpose in life. I stopped praying. I became an agnostic. I believed that all life was planless and aimless
    - No. No man has ever been able to explain the mystery of the universe-the mystery of life. We are surrounded by mysteries
    - But The fact that we don't understand the mysteries of our bodies or electricity or a gas engine doesn't keep us from using and enjoying them
    - The fact that I don't understand the mysteries of prayer and religion no longer keeps me from enjoying the richer, happier life that religion brings
    -  At long last, I realise the wisdom of Santayana's words: "Man is not made to understand life, but to live it."
    - I no longer have the faintest interest in the differences in creeds that divide the Churches. 
    - But I am tremendously interested in what religion does for me, just as I am interested in what electricity and good food and water do for me
    - Dr. A. A. Brill said: "Anyone who is truly religious does not develop a neurosis."
    - I believe God is managing affairs and that He doesn't need any advice from me. With God in charge, I believe that every-thing will work out for the best in the end. So what is there to worry about?
    - Jesus declared that there were only two important things about religion: (1) loving God with all our heart, (2) and our neighbour as ourselves
    - As I listened to that hymn, I realised that I had made a tragic mistake. I had tried to fight all my terrible battles alone. I had not taken everything to God in prayer
    - “It is safe to say that every one of them fell ill because he had lost that which the living religions of every age have given to their followers”, Dr. Carl Jung, says in his book Modern Man in Search of a Soul 
    - William James said approximately the same thing: "Faith is one of the forces by which men live," he declared, "and the total absence of it means collapse."
    - Gandhi himself said so. "Without prayer," he wrote, "I should have been a lunatic long ago."
    - But why wait till we are desperate? Why not renew our strength every day? 
    - Nobel prize scientist Dr. Alexis Carrel said “Prayer is the most powerful form of energy one can generate. It is a force as real as terrestrial gravity. As a physician, I have seen men, after all other therapy had failed, lifted out of disease and melancholy by the serene effort of prayer. ... Prayer like radium is a source of luminous, self-generating energy. ... In prayer, human beings seek to augment their finite energy by addressing themselves to the Infinite source of all energy. When we pray, we link ourselves with the inexhaustible motive power that spins the universe. We pray that a part of this power be apportioned to our needs”
    -  Why does religious faith bring us such peace and calm and fortitude? I'll let William James answer that. He says: "The turbulent billows of the fretful surface leave the deep parts of the ocean undisturbed; and to him who has a hold on vaster and more permanent realities, the hourly vicissitudes of his personal destiny seem relatively insignificant things. The really religious person is accordingly unshakable and full of equanimity, and calmly ready for any duty that the day may bring forth."
    - prayer fulfills these three very basic psychological needs which all people share, whether they believe in God or not
        ○ Prayer helps us to put into words exactly what is troubling us
        ○ Prayer gives us a sense of sharing our burdens, of not being alone
        ○ Prayer puts into force an active principle of doing. It's a first step toward action
    - A world-famous scientist said: "Prayer is the most powerful form of energy one can generate."
    - For example, you can say “O God, I can no longer fight my battles alone. I need Your help, Your love. Forgive me for all my mistakes. Cleanse my heart of all evil. Show me the way to peace and quiet and health, and fill me with love even for my enemies." 
    - Another example prayer 
    written by St. Francis seven hundred years ago:
    Lord, make me an instrument of Thy Peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy.
    O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood, as to understand; to be loved, as to love; for it is in giving that we receive, it is in pardoning, that we are pardoned and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.
    
Part Six - How To Keep From Worrying About Criticism

Chapter 20 - Remember That No One Ever Kicks A Dead Dog
    - So when you are kicked and criticised, remember that it is often done because it gives the kicker a feeling of importance. It often means that you are accomplishing something and are worthy of attention
    - this woman wasn't looking for truth. She was seeking the mean-spirited gratification that she got from tearing down someone far above her
    - Would Peary have been denounced if he had had a desk job in the Navy Department in Washington. No. He wouldn't have been important enough then to have aroused jealousy.
    - Rule 1: Remember that unjust criticism is often a disguised compliment. Remember that no one ever kicks a dead dog.

Chapter 21 - Do This-and Criticism Can't Hurt You
    - I realise now that people are not thinking about you and me or caring what is said about us
    - let's remind ourselves that that's precisely what happened to Jesus
    - Jesus was betrayed, Why should you and I expect a better score?
    - I discovered years ago that although I couldn't keep people from criticising me unjustly, I could do something infinitely more important: I could determine whether I would let the unjust condemnation disturb me
    - Let's be clear about this: I am not advocating ignoring all criticism
    - Mr. Charles Schwab declared that he had adopted that old German's words as his motto: "Just laugh."
    - Rule 2: Do the very best yon can: and then put up your old umbrella and keep the rain of criticism from running down the back of your neck

Chapter 22 - Fool Things I Have Done
    - I have a folder in my private filing cabinet marked "FTD"- short for "Fool Things I Have Done”
    - I put in that folder written records of the fools things I have been guilty of
    - I sometimes find that this weekly review makes me very unhappy. Sometimes I am astonished by my own blunders
    - Of course, as the years have gone by, these blunders have become less frequent. 
    - This system of self-analysis, continued year after year, has done more for me than any other one thing I have ever attempted.
    - Maybe H.P. Howell borrowed his idea from Ben Franklin. Only Franklin didn't wait until Saturday night. He gave himself a severe going-over every night
    - no one but myself can be blamed for my fall. I have been my own greatest enemy-the cause of my own disastrous fate
    - Wise old Ben Franklin realised that, unless he eliminated these handicaps, he wasn't going to get very far
    - Elbert Hubbard said: "Every man is a damn fool for at least five minutes every day. Wisdom consists in not exceeding that limit."
    - "The opinions of our enemies," said La Rochefoucauld, "come nearer to the truth about us than do our own opinions."
    - You and I ought to welcome that kind of criticism, too, for we can't even hope to be right more than three times out of four.
    - Lincoln welcomed criticism when he knew it was sincere, founded on knowledge, and given in a spirit of helpfulness.
    - when anyone starts to criticise me, if I do not watch myself, I instantly and automatically leap to the defensive-even before I have the slightest idea what my critic is going to say
    - In previous chapters, I have talked about what to do when you are unjustly criticised. But here is another idea: when your anger is rising because you feel you have been unjustly condemned, why not stop and say: "Just a minute. ... I am far from perfect. If Einstein admits he is wrong ninety-nine per cent of the time, maybe I am wrong at least eighty per cent of the time. Maybe I deserve this criticism. If I do, I ought to be thankful for it, and try to profit by it.
    - Rule 3: Let's keep a record of the fool things we have done and criticise ourselves. Since we can't hope to be perfect, let's do what E.H. Little did: let's ask for unbiased, helpful, constructive criticism

Part Six In A Nutshell - How To Keep From Worrying About Criticism
RULE 1: Unjust criticism is often a disguised compliment. It often means that you have aroused jealousy and envy. Remember that no one ever kicks a dead dog.
RULE 2: Do the very best you can; and then put up your old umbrella and keep the rain of criticism from running down the back of your neck.
RULE 3: Let's keep a record of the fool things we have done and criticise ourselves. Since we can't hope to be perfect, let's do what E. H. Little did: let's ask for unbiased, helpful, constructive criticism

Part Seven - Six Ways To Prevent Fatigue And Worry And Keep Your Energy And Spirits High

Chapter 23: How To Add One Hour A Day To Tour Waking Life (pg 128)
    - Dr. Edmund Jacobson declares that any nervous or emotional state "fails to exist in the presence of complete relaxation". That is another way of saying: You cannot continue to worry if you relax
    - So, to prevent fatigue and worry, the first rule is: Rest often. Rest before you get tired.
    - Soldiers hold up longer, when they throw down their packs and rest ten minutes out of every hour
    - Dr. Walter B. Cannon, of the Harvard Medical School, explains there is a definite rest period after each heart contraction. When beating at a moderate rate of seventy pulses per minute, the heart is actually working only nine hours out of the twenty-four
    - Side note: I recently saw a YouTube video of a guy saying that the difference between the top 5 tennis players and the top 25 was a mental mindset of relaxation
    - Winston Churchill, in his late sixties and early seventies, was able to work sixteen hours a day, year after year, directing the war efforts of the British Empire. He didn't cure fatigue. He didn't have to cure it. He prevented it. Because he rested frequently, he was able to work on, fresh and fit, until long past midnight.
    - When I asked Eleanor Roosevelt how she was able to carry such an exhausting schedule during the twelve years she was in the White House, she said that before meeting a crowd or making a speech, she would often sit in a chair or davenport, close her eyes, and relax for twenty minutes.
    - Edison attributed his enormous energy and endurance to his habit of sleeping whenever he wanted to.
    - He rested more than he worked-yet he did almost four times as much work as the others! Is this mere hearsay? No, you can read the record yourself in Principles of Scientific Management by Frederick Winslow Taylor.
    - Rule: rest before you get tired, and you will add one hour a day to your waking life.
    
Chapter 24: What Makes You Tired-and What You Can Do About It (pg. 130)
    - Psychiatrists declare that most of our fatigue derives from our mental and emotional attitudes
    - J.A. Hadfield, says in his book The Psychology of Power: "the greater part of the fatigue from which we suffer is of mental origin; in fact exhaustion of purely physical origin is rare."
    - Dr. A.A. Brill, goes even further. He declares: "One hundred per cent of the fatigue of the sedentary worker in good health is due to psychological factors, by which we mean emotional factors."
    - Why do we produce these unnecessary tensions in doing mental work? Josselyn says: "I find that the chief obstacle ... is the almost universal belief that hard work requires a feeling of effort, else it is not well done." So we scowl when we concentrate. We hunch up our shoulders. We call on our muscles to make the motion of effort, which in no way assists our brain in its work.m
    - What is the answer to this nervous fatigue? Relax! Relax! Relax! 
    - Learn to relax while you are doing your work!
    - Tension is a habit. Relaxing is a habit
    - How do you relax? Start with your breath
    - That’s the art of letting go 
    - Only don't make an effort to relax. Relaxation is the absence of all tension and effort. Think ease and relaxation
    - Read one of the best books ever written on this subject: Release from Nervous Tension, by Dr. David Harold Fink.

Chapter 25: How The Housewife Can Avoid Fatigue-and Keep Looking Young (pg. 133)
    - What caused the change was talking to someone, getting a little advice and a little human sympathy. What had really worked the change was the tremendous healing value that lies in-words!
    - Psycho-analysis is based, to some extent, on this healing power of words
    - Keep a notebook or scrapbook 'for "inspirational" reading. Into this book you can paste all the poems, or short prayers, or quotations, which appeal to you personally and give you a lift.
    - Don't dwell too long on the shortcomings of others. Instead, list their good qualities.
    - Get interested in your neighbours! Develop a friendly, healthy interest in the people who share the life on your street
    - Make up a schedule for tomorrow's work before you go to bed tonight
    - Finally-avoid tension and fatigue. Relax! Relax!
    - Strangely enough, a good hard floor is better to relax on than an inner-spring bed. It gives more resistance. It is good for the spine.

Chapter 26: Four Good Working Habits That Will Help Prevent Fatigue And Worry (pg. 137)
    - Good Working Habit No. 1: Clear Your Desk of All Papers Except Those Relating to the Immediate Problem at Hand.
    - It’s as simple as answering your emails and texts on the spot, when you can
    - Men do not die from overwork. They die from dissipation and worry.
    - Good Working Habit No. 2: Do Things in the Order of Their Importance.
    - Those two priceless abilities are: first, the ability to think. Second, the ability to do things in the order of their importance.
    - one of America's most successful insurance salesmen, doesn't wait until five o'clock in the morning to plan his day. He plans it the night before-sets a goal for himself- a goal to sell a certain amount of insurance that day. If he fails, that amount is added to the next day-and so on.
    - Good Working Habit No. 3. When You Face a Problem, Solve It Then and There if You Have the Facts Necessary to Make a Decision. Don't Keep Putting off Decisions.
    - Good Working Habit No. 4: Learn to Organise, Deputise, and Supervise.
    - Many a business man is driving himself to a premature grave because he has never learned to delegate responsibility to others, insists on doing everything himself.
    -  Result: details and confusion overwhelm him. He is driven by a sense of hurry, worry, anxiety, and tension

Chapter 27: How To Banish The Boredom That Produces Fatigue, Worry, And Resentment (pg. 140)
    - One of the chief causes of fatigue is boredom.
    - It is a well-known fact that your emotional attitude usually has far more to do with producing fatigue than has physical exertion
    - Joseph E. Barmack, Ph.D., published in the Archives of Psychology a report of some of his experiments showing how boredom produces fatigue
    - Dr. Edward Thorndike of Columbia is reported to have said: "Boredom is the only real cause of diminution of work."
    -  it is seldom the amount of work you do that makes you tired. You may be tired by the amount of work you do not do
    - You accomplished nothing, yet you went home exhausted-and with a splitting head. But the next day everything clicked at the office. You accomplished forty times more than you did the previous day. Yet you went home fresh as a snowy-white gardenia.
    - The lesson to be learned? Just this: our fatigue is often caused not by work, but by worry, frustration, and resentment.
    - Note: remember that worker who felt tired at the library, despite having a very easy job… yeah that’s your example
    -  The lucky folks are the ones that get to do the things they enjoy doing." Such folks are lucky because they have more energy, more happiness, less worry, and less fatigue. Where your interests are, there is your energy also. 
    - Walking ten blocks with a nagging wife can be more fatiguing than walking ten miles with an adoring sweetheart
    - This task was so boring that she resolved, in self-defence, to make it interesting. How?
    - She had a daily contest with herself She counted the number of forms she filled out each morning, and then tried to excel that record in the afternoon
    - Result? She was soon able to fill out more of these dull printed forms than any other stenographer in her division. 
    - And what did all this get her? Praise? No. ... Thanks? No. ... Promotion? No. ... Increased pay? No. ... 
    - But it did help to prevent the fatigue that is spawned by boredom. It did give her a mental stimulant. 
    - Because she had done her best to make a dull job interesting, she had more energy, more zest, and got far more happiness out of her leisure hours. I happen to know this story is true, because I married that girl.
    - there were a lot of other people who would jump at the chance to do the work I was doing
    - Also, that I was being paid a salary to do just that work
    - if I do my work as if I really enjoy it, then I do enjoy it to some extent I also found I can work faster when I enjoy my work
    - Act "as if" (William James) you were interested in your job, and that bit of acting will tend to make your interest real. It will also tend to decrease your fatigue, your tensions, and your worries.
    - Harlan Howard despised his job-but since he had to stick to it, he resolved to study ice-cream- how it was made, what ingredients were used, why some ice-creams were better than others
    - Joseph Stalin started as a secretary
    -  Harlan A. Howard will probably be one of the leaders in his profession, while some of his class-mates to whom he used to sell ice-cream over the counter will be sour, unemployed, cursing the government, and complaining that they never had a chance. Harlan A. Howard might never have had a chance, either, if he hadn't resolved to make a dull job interesting.
    - he might have remained a mechanic all his life if he had not resolved to make a dull job interesting.
    - Is giving yourself a pep talk every day silly, superficial, childish? No, on the contrary, it is the very essence of sound psychology. "Our life is what our thoughts make it." Those words are just as true today as they were eighteen centuries ago when Marcus Aurelius first wrote them in his book of Meditations: "Our life is what our thoughts make it."
    - By talking to yourself every hour of the day, you can direct yourself to think thoughts of courage and happiness, thoughts of power and peace. By talking to yourself about the things you have to be grateful for, you can fill your mind with thoughts that soar and sing
    - By thinking the right thoughts, you can make any job less distasteful
    - Keep reminding yourself that getting interested in your job will take your mind off your worries, and, in the long run, will probably bring promotion and increased pay. Even if it doesn't do that, it will reduce fatigue to a minimum and help you enjoy your hours of leisure
    - Your boss wants you to be interested in your job so that he will make more money. But let's forget about what the boss wants. Both of us can win

Chapter 28: How To Keep From Worrying About Insomnia
    - He couldn't seem to cure either, so he decided to do the next best thing-take advantage of his wakefulness. Instead of tossing and turning and worrying himself into a breakdown, he would get up and study
    - Untermyer didn't worry. "Nature," he said, "will take care of me." Nature did. In spite of the small amount of sleep he was getting, his health kept up and he was able to work as hard as any of the young lawyers of the New York Bar
    - He lived to the age of eighty-one (extremely good), this man who had rarely had a sound night's sleep; but if he had fretted and worried about his insomnia, he would probably have wrecked his life
    - we don't know how many hours of sleep each individual requires
    - during the First World War, Paul Kern, a Hungarian soldier, was shot through the frontal lobe of his brain. He recovered from the wound, but curiously enough, couldn't fall asleep
    - The doctors said he wouldn't live long. But he fooled them. He got a job, and went on living in the best of health for years. He would lie down and close his eyes and rest, but he got no sleep whatever. His case was a medical mystery that upset many of our beliefs about sleep.
    - Worrying about insomnia will hurt you far more than insomnia
    - Dr. Nathaniel Kleitman, professor at the University of Chicago, has done more research work on sleep than has any other living man. He is the world's expert on sleep. He declares that he has never known anyone to die from insomnia. To be sure, a man might worry about insomnia until he lowered his vitality and was swept away by germs. But it was the worry that did the damage, not the insomnia itself.
    - The first requisite for a good night's sleep is a feeling of security. We need to feel that some power greater than ourselves will take care of us until morning
    - Dr. Thomas Hyslop, of the Great West Riding Asylum, stressed that point in an address before the British Medical Association. He said: "One of the best sleep-producing agents which my years of practice have revealed to me-is prayer. I say this purely as a medical man”
    - No man ever committed suicide by refusing to sleep and no one ever will because the body will automatically sleep when needed
    - So, here are 5 points to remember:
        a. If yon can't sleep, do what Samuel Untermyer did. Get up and work or read until you do feel sleepy.
        b. Remember that no one was ever killed by lack of sleep. Worrying about insomnia usually causes far more damage than sleeplessness.
        c. Pray
        d. Relax your body
        e. Exercise

Part Nine - How To Lessen Your Financial Worries

Chapter 30: "Seventy Per Cent Of All Our Worries ..."
    - 70% of all our worries, according to a survey made by the Ladies' Home Journal, are about money. 
    - George Gallup, of the Gallup Poll, says that his research indicates that most people believe that they would have no more financial worries if they could increase their income by only ten per cent.
        ○ And you know what? That is true in many cases, but in a surprisingly large number of cases it is not true
    -  Mrs. Elsie Stapleton-a woman who spent years as financial adviser to the customers and employees of Wanamaker's Department Store in New York and of Gimbel's says this: I have often seen it happen that an increase in income accomplished nothing but an increase in spending-and an increase in headaches.
        ○ What causes most people to worry," she said, "is not that they haven't enough money, but that they don't know how to spend the money they have!"
    - The solution? we have to have a plan for spending our money and spend according to that plan 
    - If you wish to earn more money, then here’s the solution:  Look around you. You will find many needs that are not filled.
    - Books have been written about how to make money in your spare time; inquire at your public library
    - Book recommendation: How to Figure the Odds, by Oswald Jacoby-an authority on bridge and poker, a top-ranking mathematician, a professional statistician, and an insurance actuary.
    - Some of the most famous men in American history have had their financial troubles. Both Lincoln and Washington had to borrow money to make the trip to be inaugurated as President.
    - And let's remember this: even if we owned the entire United States with a hog-tight fence around it, we could eat only three meals a day and sleep in only one bed at a time.
