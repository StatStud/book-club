# Preface and Foreword
## Notes
> This is the universal message of every great teacher, sage, and saint: "the kingdom of heaven is within you"

No single group of system owns inner peace, for it belongs to the human spirit, by virtue of our origin.

> The major requirement for the journey is a willingness to let go of the attachment to your current experience of life.

Much of our suffering comes from clinging onto what is familiar, despite how much it hurts.

There is a small "self" (as opposed to the actual "Self"--capital S), that *enjoys*:
- impoverishment
- negativity
- being judgemental
- insecurity
- the "need" to be right
- grieving the past
- fearing the future
- craving assurance
- seeking love, instead of giving love
- self-fulfilling pessimism

Meanwhile, the Self that is actually us is waiting to be discovered, so that we may have:
- effortless success
- freedom from resentment
- gratitude for all that has happened to us
- joy
- creative expression
- win-win resolutions
- enriching optimism


It takes courage and self-honesty to see the negativity and the small self that resides within us.

Only after we have acknowledge the negativity that we're inherited from the human condition will we have the possibility to surrender and be free of it.

We simply need to be willing to acknowledge and accept that part of our human existence. 

By accepting it, we transcend it.

The mind, with its thoughts, is driven by feelings, and each feeling is the cumulative derivation of many of thousands of thoughts.

> Because most people repress, suppress, and try to escape from their feelings, the suppressed energy accumulates and seeks expression through psychosomatic distress, bodily disorders, emotional illness, and behavioral and interpersonal issues.

The accumulated feelings block spiritual growth and awareness.

Side note: This is exactly what Michale Singer talks about in his book, ["The Untethered Soul"](https://bookswithalex.com/posts/the-untethered-soul/) 

Here are the improvements we see when we let go:
1. **Behavioral**: There is less and less need for escapism via drugs, alcohol, entertainment, or excessive sleep.
    - Consequently, there is an increase in vitality, energy, presence, and well-being
2. **Physical**: Physical disorders resolve themselves with a change in attitude
3. **Interpersonal Relationships**: An increase capacity to love. Conflicts with others decrease while job performance increases.
    - self-sabotaging behaviors arising from guilt progressively subside
    - **THERE IS LESS AND LESS DEPENDENCE ON INTELLECTUALISM AND A GREATER USE OF INTUITIVE KNOWINGNESS**


# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Summary

The answer you seek is within you, and ready to be re-discovered

## Notes

The chapter opens us with so many hard truths that other people, including myself, have done to "find" that process--yoga, mediation, Jungian studies, acupuncture, fasting, etc.

Confusion is our salvation, for in the confused state, there is still hope. Confusion is the antithesis to other people's answers and ideas. As long as you are confused, you are "free".

But we reach clarity not by seeking something "out there", but rather by undoing the basis of the problem itself--the root issue from within.

It's your own freedom which you have forgotten and don't know how to experience.

Side note: This idea of "we have forgotten something innate" is mentioned in the book, ["The Inner Game of Tennis"](https://bookswithalex.com/posts/the-inner-game-of-tennis/)

What is being offered to you is not something that has to be *acquired* nor obtained externally. It's nothing new either.

> It is already yours and merely has to be reawakened and rediscovered.

# Chapter 2: The Mechanism of Letting Go

## Summary

The mechanism of letting go is the choice to release pressure, consciously and frequently, at will the moment we become aware of the pressure buildup; pressure comes as a result of involuntary reactivity. The process is just like those outlined in Michale Singer's book and The Inner Game of Tennis: **observe nonjudementally, and then let it pass while remaining open.**

The real source of stress is actually internal, by how we choose to interpret events, for it is not the *external* stimulus that is cause of stress, but our degree of *internal* reactivity. 

The great value in knowing how to surrender and let go is that any and all feelings can be let go at any time, any place, **in an instant**, consciously and effortlessly, independent of external substances, people, or events. The reward is a sudden realization  that we never needed all those thoughts after all. Instead, we are the space between those thoughts, and everything we ever need to know is already known within us.

This is why warriors are those who can handle seemingly stressful events with such inner calmness through a center of strength from within. All the great teachers, from Jesus to Buddha, have asked us to look within ourselves.

## Notes

> The technique is releasing pressure consciously and frequently at will; pressure that comes as a result of involuntary reactivity.

All of man's problems arise because he cannot sit still for 30 minutes alone with his own thoughts.

But it is not the thoughts or facts that make us uneasy, but how we choose to interpret those facts and the resulting feeling that arises from that choice. Thoughts and facts are painless and neutral by themselves.

> It is the accumulated pressure of feelings that causes thoughts.

According to neuroscientist Gray LaViiolette, thoughts are filed in the memory bank according to the various shades of feelings associated with those thoughts

> That's why we learn best when we mix lessons with emotions.

The great value in knowing how to surrender is that any and all feelings can be let go at any time, any place, **in an instant**, consciously and effortlessly.

This means we don't need food, caffeine, alcohol, or any other external substance to get out of our own head.

> So, what is this **surrendered state**? It's a state free of negative feelings in a given area so that creativity and spontaneity can manifest without opposition or the interference of inner conflicts.

Side note: Michale Singer wrote a book called "The Surrender Experiment". I have not read it yet, but I wonder how it relates to this idea.

> To be free of inner conflict and expectations is to give others in our life the greatest freedom. It allows us to experience the basic nature of the universe, which will be discovered, is **to manifest the greatest good possible in a situation**.

### Feelings and Mental Mechanisms

We have three ways of handling feelings:
1. suppression/repression
    - repression is done unconsciously, while suppression is done consciously
    - arising from social and societal customs
    - suppression creates unneeded tension that leads to completely avoidable health complications
    - Feelings are commonly repressed through denial and projection; we maintain our self-esteem at the expense of others
2. expression
    - expression **DOES NOT** free you from emotions; it actually gives the emotion more energy
    - Just enough negative feelings are released; the rest of the negatives are repressed
    - leads to self-indulgence at the expense of others
    - Often a misinterpretation of what Freud emphasized, which is the neutralization, sublimation, and socialization of negative feelings that are then channeled into constructive drives of love, work, and creativity
    - but dumping our negative feelings on others, even therapists, is simply an expression of complaining, which is self-reinforcing and does not build a heroic narrative
3. escape
    - classic avoidance through vices or even workaholic traits
    - people want to stay unconscious to avoid the negatives because they are terrified to face themselves; they cannot handle being alone
    - The effect is the inability to truly love and trust other people, resulting in emotional isolation and self-hatred (think Gaby)

### Feelings and Stress

The real source of stress is actually internal, by how we choose to interpret events.

The more fear we have on the inside, the more our perception of the world is charged with fear. How we view the world is how the world reacts to us.

- to the fearful person, the world is a terrifying place
- to the angry person, the world is a chaos of frustration 
- to the guilty person, the world is a pit of temptation and sin

> what we are holding inside colors our world.

> It is not the external stimulus that is cause of stress, but our degree of reactivity.

That's why people who find comfort in the uncomfortable have great resilience.

### Life events and emotions

Again, thoughts create our destiny:
- the person with a lot of repressed grief will unconsciously create sad events
- the fearful person precipitates frightening experiences
- the angry person becomes surrounded by infuriating circumstances
- the prideful person is constantly being insulted

All the great teachers, from Jesus to Buddha, have asked us to look within ourselves.

Because emotions emit a vibration energy, they affect and determine the people who are in our lives. Life events become influenced by our repressed and suppressed emotions on the physic level (e.g. anger attracts anger thoughts, anger thoughts attract anger actions, anger actions attract anger circumstances).

> like attracts like.

The rich get richer and the poor get poorer applies to people's state of mind. Ultimately, those who have, get--and we all have it, but few choose to get it.

Those with a prosperity complex bring abundance to their lives.

### The Mechanism of Letting Go

Letting go involves:
1. being aware of a feeling
2. letting it come up
3. staying with it
4. letting it run its course and pass through you

It's the exact same idea behind Michale Singer's idea of letting the feeling pass through you with openness. The first step is to allow yourself to experience the emotion without:
- fighting it
- condemning it
- fearing it
- moralizing it

> It means to observe **nonjudgementally**, and regard it as just another wave of emotion

To be sure, the best way to fail with the mechanism is to use any of the negative techniques such as (1) repression/suppression (2) expression (3) escape

> When you give up resiting or trying to modify the feeling, it will shift to the next feeling and be accompanied by a lighter sensation

And here's why we are motivated/incentivize to follow-through with the mechanism of letting go:

> The reward of letting go is a progressive diminishing of dependance on anything or anyone outside of ourselves.

### Resistance to letting go

Letting go is a natural ability, and it's best done by simply doing it.

Eventually, it will be seen that all thoughts are resistance; they are all images that the mind has made to prevent us from experiencing what actually *is*.

> The **real** Self is the space between the thoughts; the field of silent awareness underneath all thoughts.

If thoughts are the goldfish, then we are the water surrounding the fish.

An example of this is when we are totally absorbed in whatever we're doing; that state of deep work when we don't notice the passing of time. The mind was quiet, and we were simply doing without resistance nor effort. Perhaps busy, but relaxed.

> We suddenly realized that we never needed all those thoughts after all.

> Inside of us, but out of our awareness, is the truth that "I already know everything I need to know", and this happens automatically.

Naturally, there is the fear that, if we let go of our desire for something, then we won't get it.

It is then beneficial to let go of some of the commonly held beliefs:
- we only deserve things through hard work, struggle, sacrifice, and effort
    - Side note: but how does this line-up with Carol Deweck's book, "Mindset"?
- Suffering is beneficial and good for us
- We don't get anything for nothing
- Things that are very simple are not worth much

Letting go of the above psychological barriers will allow an enjoyment of its effortlessness and ease.

# Chapter 3: The Anatomy of Emotions

## Summary

We start this chapter by first uncovering the primary goal of mankind, which is that of survival (both personal survival and survival of one's identified group, community, and members). The mind learns so that it can survive to the next generation. Consequently, our minds have adapted to use emotions as shorthands for thoughts by using reason to achieve emotional needs. Each activity or desire will reveal that the basic goal is to achieve a certain feeling (validation, pleasure, peace, etc.). Emotions are therefore connected with what we *believe* will ensure our survival, not with what *actually* will.

This then leads us to ask: How can we overcome our emotions to heal from life crises and past traumas? 

The answer is simple: Start by non-judgementally *observing* your negative emotions, then choosing to let them go by *surrendering* and asking "what am I feeling this way for?", and then, discover *within yourself* the opposite positive emotions that represent the greatness that lives within you. Letting go of negative feelings, and surrendering to positive ones.

When the fear of one of the smaller emotional units is acknowledged and released, all the alternative positive possibilities that exist will becomes suddenly apparent. Mastery of letting it go is mastery over fear, and the unblocking of whole avenues of life experiences that previously had been avoided due to self-imposed inhibitions from fear.

Self-awareness is increased much more rapidly by observing feelings rather than thoughts. When that inner emptiness, due to lack of self-worth, is replaced by true self-love, self-respect, and esteem, we no longer have to seek it in the world, for that source of happiness is **within ourselves**.

## Notes

> Simplicity is the hallmark of truth

### The Goal of Survival

> The primary goal of mankind is survival

Every human desire seeks to ensure one's personal survival and survival of one's identified groups (family, friends, community, country, etc).

One of the greatest fears of humans is the loss of the capacity to experience, makes influences people to choose to believe that they are their bodies, and that they need their body to experience life.

It is therefore common for humans to look outside of themselves for the satisfaction of their needs, which leads them to experience themselves as vulnerable because they are insufficient unto themselves.

> The mind is, therefore, a primarily survival mechanism through the use of emotions.

Thoughts are engendered by the emotions, and these reactive emotions become shorthand for thoughts.

Emotions are more basic and primitive than mental processes. *Reason* is the tool the mind uses to achieve its *emotional* needs.

The issue is that these emotions many times are below our awareness, leading to actions taken without a reason.

The simple way to become conscious of the underlying emotional goal behind any action or behavior is by asking yourself, "what for?"

Then, ask again, "what for?", until you get deeper and deeper.

This is very similar to CBT and how we dig deep into the core beliefs.

When you question each logical reason with "what for?" continually, we reveal that there are feelings of insecurity and lack of fulfillment.

Each activity or desire will reveal that the basic goal is to achieve a certain *feeling*.

Think about this! You desire nice things because you want the good feelings that come from it, whether it's
- validation from others
- sexual pleasure
- peace

They're all just feelings.

Emotions are therefore connected with what we *believe* will ensure our survival, not with what *actually* will.

Emotions themselves are actually the cause of the basic fear that drives everyone to seek constantly seek security.

### The Scale of Emotions

Everything emits energy, either positive or negative. In this section, we review the levels of consciousness from the book, "Power versus Force".

Above the level of Courage, people *seek us out* because we give energy to them ("power") and we have good will towards them.

Below the level of Courage, people *avoid us* because we *take* energy from them ("force") and we want to use them for our own material or emotional needs.

### Understanding Emotions

Similar to what was already mentioned in chapter two with Gray-LaViolette, all thoughts are filed in the mind's memory bank under a filing system based upon the associated feeling and its finer gradations.

> There have been scientific observations that **self-awareness is increased** much more rapidly **by observing feelings** rather than thoughts

Why might this be? Because there are thousands of thoughts connected to one emotion, so the understanding of the **underlying emotion** and its correct handling is, therefore, more rewarding and less time-consuming than dealing with one's thoughts.

This section introduced a great illustration of the power of letting go, I'll summarize here:
- Man loses passport a few hours before his trip
- **reactively**, the man *panics*, and begins negative self-talk
- With no victory from the negative self-talk, the man **remembers** to surrender
- The man sits down and asks himself, "What for? **What is the basic feeling that I've been ignoring?**"
    - The man identified that he is acting through guilt, shame, and fear
    - The man realizes that, while missing the plane would suck, the world still continues to function..the man is at peace with his fate
- At peace, the man instantly remembers where he placed the passport
- The man now **responds** with gratitude and happiness


> From the above, we conclude: **letting go** can be **very powerful** in both everyday practical life situations, as well as life crisis when we are bombarded with emotions.


### Handling Emotional Crises

Recall from the previous chapter that the mind unconsciously uses suppression/repression, expression, and escape to handle emotional crises.

These techniques, when used consciously, can actually be useful by disassembling the emotion into smaller peaces so it's easier to let go, piece-by-piece. But the key word here is *consciously* and *sparingly*.

Thus, in the event of a crises, it may perfectly fine to *consciously* push away as much of the emotion we are capable of at the current moment, especially if it's an overwhelming crises.

> Every strong emotion is really comprised of a number of smaller, less complex emotional units that can be disassembled.

When the fear of one of the smaller emotional units is acknowledged and released, all the alternative possibilities that exist will becomes suddenly apparent.

As the disassembled emotional complex is taken apart into its emotional units, each emotional unit now has less energy and can be surrendered individually, rather than being overwhelmed with so many emotions.

Handling a crisis from the emotional standpoint, rather than the intellectual one, will shorten its duration dramatically.

Think about it: if someone loses a job, handling the loss from an intellectual standpoint will produce thousands of hypothetical situations and worse-case scenarios, producing sleepless nights.

Until the underlying emotion is surrendered, the thoughts will be engendered endlessly.

There are numerous benefits to handling a life crises successfully; the feeling of self-esteem and greater awareness gives confidence in one knowing that he can survive and handle whatever life brings.

There is an overall reduction of the fear of life, a greater feeling of mastery, compassion for the suffering of others, and increased ability to help them through similar circumstances.

### Healing the Past

Another emotional technique to deal with unresolved issues, especially those from the past, is to place the event in a different context.

That is, see it from a different perspective through a different meaning. This is one of the most effective tools for handling the past.

All we have to do is give it a different meaning.

> We take on a different attitude about the past difficulty or trauma, and we acknowledge the hidden gift in it

Side note: This is exactly what happened with Lauren. Although the project did not end well, I found a new band of people worth working with.

This idea of reframing the past is endorsed by Viktor Frankl (Logotherapy).

> "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing, the last of the human freedoms: to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances." --Viktor Frankl

> Every life experience, no matter how tragic, contains a hidden gem of a lesson

> All forbidden impulses, thoughts, feelings, and actions can be resolved with iterative probing of "so what?".

Fear of life is really the fear of emotions.

It is not the facts that we fear but our feelings about them.

So, once we have mastery over our feelings, our fear of life diminishes.

How do we master our feelings? Start by first nonjudgmentally observing them, then, let them go. It's that simple.

> Fear is the bias of all inhibitions. Mastery over fear means the unblocking of whole avenues of life experiences that previously had been avoided.

Thus, the man who successfully handles the crisis of losing a job will never again experience the same fear.

Instead, he will actually be far more creative, taking new risks, and earning higher success in life.

He will witness how the haunting fear of job loss had severely limited his performance in the past year, made him fearful and cautious, and cost him self-esteem due to his compliance with his superiors.

Another benefit of a life-crisis is greater self-awareness. This is because we are forced to take a good look at our life situation and re-evaluate our beliefs, goals, values, and life direction. It is an opportunity to let go of guilt and have a total shift in our attitude.

> The part of us that wants to cling to negative emotions is our smallest self.

> The world can only see us as we see ourselves.

Picture yourself as being generous, forgiving, loving, and experiencing your inner greatness. **Instantly** there will be an enormous increase in muscle strength as a result of positive bio-energy.

Smallest on the other hand (picturing yourself as mean, petty, cheap, etc) brings sickness, disease, weakness, and death.

Letting go will help the stopping of negative emotions.

### Enhancing Positive Emotions

> The corollary to letting go of negative feelings is to stop resisting the positive ones.

Whenever we experience negative emotions, it's quite helpful to imagine the positive opposite version, and practice letting go.

Here's an example (personal one): Imagine Lauren scheduled a 1:1 with you. You may start feeling fear, resentment, hatred, trapped. The opposite of those feelings would be courage, admiration,love, and free.

We can **look within ourselves** for those positive opposites emotions--courage, admiration, love, and free-will, and stop resisting them.

We then realize that part of our nature has always been willing to be positive--to be courageous, loving, respectful, and enthusiastic, but we didn't give it a chance. 

> We instead thought we were punishing the other person by holding the resentment, but we have actually been repressing love.


> The purpose of this exercise is to locate within ourselves that which can only be described as **greatness**

Greatness is the courage to overcome obstacles. It is the willingness to move to a higher level of love. It is the acceptance of other's humanness and having compassion for their suffering.

With this increased awareness of who we really are comes the progressive invulnerability of pain.

> Out of the recognition of who we really are comes the desire to seek that which is uplifting, out of which arises a new meaning and context for life.

> When that inner emptiness, due to lack of self-worth, is replaced by true self-love, self-respect, and esteem, we no longer have to seek it in the world, for that source of happiness is **within ourselves**.

It dawns on us that it cannot be supplied by the world anyway.

When we use these techniques of relinquishing the negative and surrendering the positive, we come into a sudden, comprehensive awareness of our true dimension.

Once this has been experienced, it will never be forgotten. The world will never intimidate us again as it once did.

Outwardly, the behavior may appear the same, but inwardly, the causes for it are now totally different.

We go through life balanced and graceful.

# Chapter 4: Apathy and Depression

## Summary

Apathy and depression is merely a veneer for fear; behind every "I can't" is actually a "I won't because I'm afraid of/to..."--it is an issue of **unwillingness**, not *inadequacy*. We are free to hang onto negativity as long as we want, from our own choosing.

This leads us to ask one of the foundational questions of this book: what is the purpose of higher consciousness? 

To begin with, it means to start looking for the truth for ourselves, rather than blindly subscribing to whatever we're programmed to follow by media or society. Becoming more conscious means accepting greater **responsibility** for what we **choose** to take personally into our psyche. We ultimately begin to realize that we have a choice--it is a questioning of *everything*. This affects the habits we choose, the relationships we foster, and ultimately the fate of our lives. 

Blame is an example of a programmed attitude that much of society accepts. When we play the blame game, we get the short-term payoff of being victimized, but at the long-term cost of our freedom--for how can we be the heros and captains of our life is we are slaves to the things that happen to us?

**But here's the trick**: We have to be honest and realize that we are blaming because we *choose* to blame. This is true, no matter how *justified* the circumstances may appear to be. It is not a matter of right or wrong, but merely a matter of taking responsibility for our own consciousness, psyche, interpretations, and stories.

Every feeling has its opposite. The way out of negativity is therefore the **willingness** to acknowledge and *let go* of negative feelings while simultaneously the **willingness** to *let go* of resisting of their positive opposite.

One surprising effect of the willingness to let go of our inner negativity is the discovery that the polar opposite of the negative feelings, the positive, exist. This is the inner reality that we call our "inner greatness" or "Higher Self", and it has unlimited creative capacity in all realms of life: employment, relationships, health, etc. In return for letting go of the payoffs that we are getting from the negative position, we are now surprised by the positive payoffs that stem from the power of our Higher Self.

No matter what others or society says, you are free to refuse to buy into the negative thought form. By refusing to accept the negative belief, it now has **zero impact** over our life. By that same token, If we have power to manifest negativity, then we have power to manifest positivity.

Here is one of the laws of consciousness: we are only subject to a negative thought or belief if we *consciously* say that it *applies to us*. **We are free to *choose* not to buy into a negative belief system.**


## Notes

### I can't versus I won't

The biological purpose of apathy is to summon aid. Apathy indicates a lack of life energy and closeness to death.

The way out of apathy is to *remind* ourselves of our intentions, which is to get higher and freer--to become more effective and happy, and to let go of the resistance to the technique itself.

It's reminding does not help, simply look at the current fruits that apathy yields in your life--are you happy with those fruits? It's your choice.

Most "I can't" are often:
- "I won't"
- "I'm afraid to"
- "I have too much pride to try, for fear I may fail"

Behind the "I won't" is a reason "...because I am afraid". That is how we move upwards from apathy to fear in the consciousness map.

Fear is a higher energy level than apathy. Fear at least begins to motivate us into action.

Apathy is merely a veneer for fear.

There was such a good, detailed description of the typical self-improvement path of many people, that I decided to include the whole section here:

![](/letting-go1.png)

This is the power of self-help groups: the sharing of inner experiences, from the lowest to the highest levels on the scale of emotions.

> What does it mean to become more conscious?

To begin with, it means to start looking for the truth for ourselves, rather than blindly subscribing to whatever we're programmed to follow by media or society.

Becoming more conscious means accepting greater responsibility for what we choose to take personally into our psyche. We ultimately begin to realize that we have a choice.

We can stop giving authority to all of the mind's thoughts, and begin to question them, and find out if there is really any truth in them for ourselves--it is a questioning of *everything*. 

We learn that doing something new means being willing to let go of pride. We look at the cost as ask, 

> "Am I willing to continue to pay this price? Would I be willing to let go of the fear of not succeeding. Would I be willing to let go of resisting the effort required? Would I be willing to let go of the vanity so that I could allow myself to be awkward as a learner? Could I let go of my stinginess and smallness and be willing to pay for the lessons and give the time?"

> As all of the associated feelings are surrendered, it becomes clear that the real reason is unwillingness--not inadequacy

It must be remembered that we are free to acknowledge and surrender our feelings, and we are free not to surrender. We are perfectly free to refuse to let go.

We are free to hang onto negativity as long as we want, from our own choosing.

We are free agents.

### Blame

Let's first look at what makes blame so appealing.

Blame is the world's greatest excuse. It enables us to remain limited and small without feeling guilty. If we blame others for our troubles, then we get to be the innocent victim and the other party is the bad one; we enjoy the self-pity and the sympathy of others.

But there is a cost: the loss of our freedom.

The role of the victim brings with it a self-perception of weakness, vulnerability, and helplessness, which are the major components to apathy and depression.

The first step out of blame is by nonjudementally observing that we are *choosing* to blame.

The right approach is to forgive, forget, and give new meaning to the context. 

We can see the right approach with Victor Frankl, who chose to forgive the Nazi guards and discover a hidden gift in his experience at the concentration camps.

> **But here's the trick**: We have to be honest and realize that we are blaming because we *choose* to blame. This is true, no matter how *justified* the circumstances may appear to be.

> It is not a matter of right or wrong, bt merely a matter of taking responsibility for our own consciousness, psyche, interpretations, and stories.

To overcome blame, we get to be willing to surrender all of the little payoffs for something far greater.

Depression and apathy result from the **willingness** to hang on the small self and its belief systems, plus the **resistance** to our Higher Self, which consist of all the opposites of the negative feelings.

Who would I become reversed what I was willing to accept and resist?

> Every feeling has its opposite. The way out of negativity is therefore the **willingness** to acknowledge and let go of negative feelings while simultaneously the **willingness** to let go of resisting of their positive opposite.

The tricky thing with blame is that the mind can make up *reasonably sound* justifications. "I don't have time", "I don't deserve to give it up", "I can't forget what she did to me", "she should apologize to me first",etc.

In this case, two things are operating:
1. clinging to negativity and smallness within us
2. resisting the positive and greatest within us

> Here is one of the laws of consciousness: we are only subject to a negative thought or belief if we *consciously* say that it *applies to us*. **We are free to *choose* not to buy into a negative belief system.**

This is life changing. No matter what the media says, whether it's a recession, dating crisis for young men, or the decay of American society, I am free to refuse to buy into the negative thought form.

We can say instead:
- "unemployment does not apply to me"
- "recessions do not apply to me"
- "gender wars do not apply to me"
- "mental sickness does not apply to me"
- "loneness does not apply to me"

> By refusing to accept the negative belief, it now has **zero value** over our life.

If we have power to manifest negativity, then we have power to manifest positivity.

### Choosing the positive

One surprising effect of the willingness to let go of our inner negativity is the discovery that the polar opposite of the negative feelings, the positive, exist.

This is the inner reality that we call our "inner greatness" or "Higher Self".

In return for letting go of the payoffs that we are getting from the negative position, we are now surprised by the positive payoffs that stem from the power of our positive feelings.

One example of this is that when we let go of blame (small self), we surrender to and experience forgiveness (higher self).

When we let go of payoffs from the small self, we experience the **unlimited capacity** that is our higher self.

Our high self can **CREATE**:
- employment opportunities
- situations for the healing of relationships
- opportunities to give and receive love
- empower new financial, health, and well-being goals

This empowerment results in a rise in self-esteem, the return of creativity, and the opening of a positive vision of the future that replaces fearlessness.

If you have trouble practicing positivity, you can tell yourself that you're just doing an experiment, for purpose for which is to learn. The purpose is to also become familiar with the laws of consciousness and witness, in real time, the phenomenon to occur.

> The mind projects on to the future with the expectation that the past will be repeated.

When we discover this unconscious dynamic, we can choose to look again at the emotional complex disassemble it into its emotional units, let go of each negative component, and then let go of the resistance of its positive opposite.

The more we do this, the more our perspective of the future changes, the more the world changes, and the more hwo the world responds to us changes.

Here are some questions to ask yourself when you observe your small self:
- How long am I willing to pay the cost?
- How much blame is enough?
- Is there a time to call an end to it?
- How long will I hang on to it?
- How much shame is enough?
- How much self-punishment is enough?
- When does the sentence come to and end?
- Where has my bitterness taken me?


Now, ask these questions:
- Did school teach me courses on consciousness?
- Did anyone ever tell me that I had freedom to choose what went into my mind?
- Was I ever taught I could refuse all of the negative programming?
- Did anyone ever tell me the laws of consciousness?
- Why not stop beating ourselves up right now?

> We all did what we thought was best in the moment.

### The company we keep

Another valuable technique for overcoming apathy and depression, and the "I can't/I won't" attitudes, is to choose to surround yourself with people who have resolved the issues you're currently facing. **This is one of the great powers of self-help groups.**

Those who are in a higher vibration are free of the energy from their negative thoughts and have energized positive thought forms. To merely be in their presence is beneficial enough.

We are either positively or negatively influenced by the company we keep.


# Chapter 5: Grief

## Summary

Because what we hold in minds tends to manifest, the fear of a loss can, paradoxically, be the mechanism of bringing about the loss.

To handle the fear of loss, we have to look at what purpose the external person or object serves in our life. What emotional need is being fulfilled? What emotion would arise if we lost that person or thing that we are so attached to?

Anger is another emotion associated with grief, and results from prior refusal to accept **the fact that all relationships and possessions in this life are transitory**

We often feel that what has become important or comforting to us is a permanent attachment, but this is among the biggest mistakes people choose to believe.

"Impotent rage" is associated with the desire to change the nature of the world and the impossibility of doing so.

## Notes

### Allowing grief

Grief comes from losing something we cherish. It comes at the result of the denial of the fact that **all** relationships are transitory in nature (this too shall pass).

Grief comes from seeking to obtain love from *outside* of us; we begin by looking at our lives, identifying those areas of attachments, and asking ourselves: 
- what *internal* needs are they satisfying? 
- What feeling would come up if I were to lose them? 
- Why am I so empty *within myself*, that I have to search for solutions in the form of attachment and dependency *on others*? 
- Where am I looking to get love rather than to give it? 
- If the person/people I'm with become happier elsewhere, how would I feel about that?

The greater our attachment to that which is *outside* of ourselves, the greater is our overall fear of, and vulnerability to, loss.

When grief hits, let it pass by choosing **acceptance**; acceptance calibrates higher than willingness, and permits us to use grief to reach new heights of consciousness by letting go of the resentments that hold it down.

The more loving we are, the less vulnerable we are to grief and loss, and the less we need to seek attachments (attachments are not limited to physical, worldly, materialistic possessions, but generally include anything outside of ourselves that we rely upon).That part of us which we refer to as our greater Self seeks to give love rather than obtain it. 

For what can be obtained if it is already in possession?


### Healing Loss

> Because what we hold in minds tends to manifest, the fear of a loss can, paradoxically, be the mechanism of bringing about the loss.

To handle the fear of loss, we have to look at what purpose the external person or object serves in our life. What emotional need is being fulfilled? What emotion would arise if we lost that person or thing that we are so attached to?

If loss can be anticipated, we can better handle the various fears associated with the sense of loss by disassembling the emotional units.

For example, a pet dog that's near his expiration date may evoke feelings of sadness over the inevitable loss that's around the corner. You ask yourself, 

> "what purpose is the dog serving in my life? What is his emotional service to me? Love, companionship, touch? Will losing the dog leave these personal emotional needs unfulfilled?"

By following this deeper and deeper why questioning, some of the fears can be acknowledged and relinquished. Once the fear is let go, you don't have to resort to denial and pretend to yourself that your dog will live forever.

> Anger is another emotion associated with grief, and results from prior refusal to accept **the fact that all relationships and possessions in this life are transitory**

We often feel that what has become important or comforting to us is a permanent attachment, but this is among the biggest mistakes people choose to believe.

"Impotent rage" is associated with the desire to change the nature of the world and the impossibility of doing so.

When loss seems inevitable, many people will start treating symptoms by overcompensating with good works. A faltering relationship will have one side start acting more loving.

> When the denial breaks down, and the manipulation stop working, and the fear has passed through, depression itself is what's left and the actual process of mourning and grief take place.

But all of these emotional stages can be worked through more rapidly by the process of letting go.

What does this mean?

> It means the inevitability of the emotion of grief is surrendered to and replaced by a willingness to let go of resistance and let the process pass through and complete itself


Instead of denial and resistance, you plunge into it and get it over.

Grief can either lead down destructively to anger (a lower consciousness level) or acceptance (an even higher consciousness level). Acceptance and resignation are **not** the same thing: resignation is a half-ass acceptance of the facts ("I don't like it, but I *have to* put up with it"), whereas acceptance has an earnest and sincere acceptance of newfound perspective in light of new data.

Resignation still clings with residual resentment over the facts, whereas acceptance reaches new heights by letting go of the resentments that hold it down.

> Acceptance calibrates at 350--much higher than courage (200) or even willingness (310). As bad as grief may be, it can be the door through which acceptance grants us the creative aspects of the mind to develop opportunities for new life situations and further options for growth and experience, accompanied by a new sense of aliveness.

Nearly all 12-step self-help groups follow this frame of mind with the **serenity prayer**: 

> God, grant me the **serenity** to accept that things I cannot change, the **courage** to change the things I can, and the **wisdom** to know the difference.

To not accept, is to prolong unnecessary suffering.

### Preventing Grieving

As we have explored, the basis of all mourning and loss is attachment, plus the denial of the transitory nature of **all** relationships

> We can begin by looking at our lives, identifying those areas of attachments, and asking ourselves, "what *internal* needs are they satisfying? What feeling would come up if I were to lose them?"

The greater our attachment to that which is *outside* of ourselves, the greater is our overall fear of and vulnerability to loss.

> "Why am I so empty within myself, that I have to search for solutions in the form of attachment and dependency on others?"

We begin to look within ourselves at our own areas of immaturity.

> Specifically, we need to examine the question: **"Where am I looking to get love rather than to give it?"**

The more loving we are, the less vulnerable we are to grief and loss, and the less we need to seek attachments (attachments are not limited to physical, worldly, materialistic possessions, but generally include anything outside of ourselves that we rely upon).

It is in this action of letting go of negativity that we outgrow our smallness and  experience and rediscover our internal greatness of joy that comes from the *pleasure* of **giving and loving**--we become **immune** to the losses of the world.

"Do what feels good" is both sound advice and terrible advice under different contexts: Feeling good from escaping through vices that are outsides of us leads to death, but feeling good by doing good inside of ourselves leads to everlasting life.

> When the source of happiness is found *within* we are immune to the losses of the world.

### Mid-life crises

Again, attachments are not limited to materialistic things. A woman can find herself attached when she faces empty nest syndrome, and a man can face the same if he loses the job he so desperately sacrificed for.

The reaction typically occurs suddenly in middle age, due to many years of pre-existing denial.

There is often a lack of facing the inevitable and making plans for other life activities that would gratify the same inner needs which, in these cases, are feelings of:
- self-esteem
- importance
- wanting to feel needed and significant
- the need to make a contribution and be productive

> So, anticipation of the inevitable and preparing for it **now** both bring relatively *minor* discomfort compared to traumatic grief and loss at a **later date**.

> Here's a **VERY IMPORTANT** question to ask yourself in all of your relationships: "If their happiness were best served by leaving me, how would I feel about it?"

This question, and the inner work that follows from it, reveals the degree to which we are trying to restrict and control the other person--in which case, it's not love, rather another form of attachment.

But as we have discussed, it is only the small part of the self that becomes attached; the greater Self is immune to attachment. The purpose of letting go is to de-energize the habits of the small self so that they no longer run us; then, we are free to expand into greater awareness of our higher Self.

> That part of us which we refer to as our greater Self seeks to give love rather than obtain it. For what can be obtained if it is already in possession?

Immunity to grief of loss occurs when we replace dependence on the small self (the personality) with dependance on the higher Self (the Divinity within).

We look for security to the Self, which is eternal, instead of the small self, which is transitory.

# Chapter 6: Fear

## Summary
The fact that we can face fear and surrender it permits us to move up instantly to courage; on the other side of fear is new heights of consciousness.

With more experience, you will inevitably get better, but only if you choose to start, and you can only start if you choose to drop your ego, have humility, and laugh at yourself when you’re failing in the beginning. The reward for the willingness to be laughed at is continued, sustained, effortless, compounding success.

By letting go of fear and letting go of the resistance of love, our capacity to give love increases progressively, and the loving energy has the capacity to heal ourselves as well as others. This love is intrinsically within us, and this love can be rediscovered by letting go of fear.

We have conscious fantasy that the fear is keeping us alive. Recall from chapter 3 the anatomy of emotions, and how emotions are connected with what we believe will ensure our survival, not with what actually will. Fear is associated with our primitive survival mechanisms. We believe that we become vulnerable if we let go of fear.

But as we just mentioned, like attracts like. Fear is what binds us to the real dangers of life. It is fear and guilt that become actualized from the mind and hurt us in the long run.

Does that mean we stay unprotected and take hasty risks? Certainly not. Instead, take the same protective actions out of love rather than fear. It’s the same difference between passion and aggression–one is based on love while another on fear.

99% of guilt has ZERO to do with reality. Reprogram your own mind.

## Notes

As we let go of fear, we find that behind it, there is often anger at the object of fear itself. The willingness to let go of fear reveals the anger at the object of fear itself, which brings us up higher in consciousness than fear.

The fact that we can face fear and surrender it permits us to move up instantly to courage.

### Fear of Public speaking

When we stop being afraid, we notice that it's just a feeling. Or, as Teddy Roosevelt said:

> "There is nothing to fear, but fear itself"

> Another law of consciousness: what one holds in mind tends to manifest in reality.

Thus, fear engenders fear; the more we cling to fear, the more likely the fear will actualize.

Humor is valuable in public speaking; it is a way of just being at one with the humanness of the audience, and discovering their compassion. 

With more experience, you will inevitably get better, but only if you choose to start, and you can only start if you choose to drop your ego, have humility, and laugh at yourself when you're failing in the beginning. The reward for the willingness to be laughed at is continued, sustained, effortless, compounding success.  

### The Healing Effect

Jerry Jampolsky wrote a book titled, "Love is letting go of Fear". The title itself is true.

Think about it. When I was paranoid, Sutanay responded with openness and empathy. And it worked.

High levels of consciousness are capable of healing, transforming, enlightening, and inspiring others. People like Mother Teresa, MLK, and Roger Banister are examples.

By letting go of fear and letting go of the resistance of love, our capacity to give love increases progressively, and the loving energy has the capacity to heal ourselves as well as others.

The only drawback of healing someone through conscious loving thoughts is that illness returns as soon as the highly conscious person leaves, unless the sick person learns to elevate their own consciousness.

Although hospital beds are filled with patients who have families wishing their recovery, many of these wishes/thoughts are based in fear, anguish, guilt, and ambivalence.

It was Jesus who said that with faith, we can move mountains and have the power to heal.

The saint, or person of high consciousness, is defined by one who has removed the clouds of negativity and radiates the full healing power of the sun.

It's the same power that comes from the unconditional love of a mother or father.

This same love is intrinsically within us, and this love can be **rediscovered** by letting go of fear.

### Owning the "Shadow"

Carl Jung said that the self cannot become healed and whole unless we look at and acknowledge the shadow.

This shadow, or "collective unconscious" represents everything that we most dislike admitting about ourselves (the term, "collective unconscious" means that *everyone* has these thoughts and fantasies).

There is nothing secret about the fears that we all hide--fear of appearing dumb, ugly, unlovable, and a failure.

The average human would much rather project his shadow onto the world, condemn it, and see it as evil, thinking that his problem is to battle with evil in the world.

In actuality, the problem is merely to **acknowledge**, non-judgementally, the presense of such thoughts and impulses within ourselves. 

By acknowledging non-judgementally, they become quiet. Once they are quiet, they no longer unconsciously run us.

The fear of the unknown is really the fear of the depths of our consciousness, or our shadow.

In addition to love, another helpful cure is...HUMOR! :)

Once looked at and acknowledged, the shadow no longer has any power.

It is only our fear of these thoughts and impulses that give them any power, much like how reactive fear to a bully only makes the bully stronger, since that is what he's expecting.

Once we become aquatinted with our shadow, we no longer have to project our fears upon the world, and they begin to evaporate rapidly.

This is what makes people so attracted to action, violent films and TV programs, like films by Quentin Tarantino, Serial Killer documentaries, etc.

Because what is being acted out, on screen, are all the forbidden unconscious fantasies in our own psyche.

Once we are willing to look at the same internal films that represent our shadow within ourselves, the attraction towards these violent forms of entertainment disappears.

The unconscious mind is not polite. It thinks of gross concepts.

Look deep within yourself next time somebody cuts you off in traffic, and picture what you would really do to that person if you were strictly honest with yourself and did not censor the images coming to mind. That's the way the unconscious thinks.

The reason why a sense of humor is useful because these images are comical to look at. There is nothing awful about it, just the way the unconscious handles images. It jsut means that you have gotten honest and faced how the human animal mind operates in this dimension.

It takes a lot of energy to keep the shadow buried and to suppress our multitude of fears. The result is energy depletion. On the emotional level, it is expressed as an inhibition of the capacity to love.

In the world of consciousness, like attracts like, so we can either attract fear or love. You choose.

So, it seems clear that fear is not the way, yet, most people cling to fear. Why?

We have conscious fantasy that the fear is keeping us alive. Recall from chapter 3 the anatomy of emotions, and how emotions are connected with what we *believe* will ensure our survival, not with what *actually* will. Fear is associated with our primitive survival mechanisms. We believe that we become vulnerable if we let go of fear.

But as we just mentioned, like attracts like. Fear is what binds us to the real dangers of life. It is fear and guilt that become actualized from the mind and hurt us in the long run.

Does that mean we stay unprotected and take hasty risks? Certainly not. Instead, take the same protective actions out of love rather than fear. It's the same difference between passion and aggression--one is based on love while another on fear.

### Guilt

Guilt is a substitute for a sense of reality in a mind that is underdeveloped; it is a learned behavior to prevent repetition of a mistake.

> 99% of guilt has **ZERO** to do with **reality**

Most pious, meek individuals are actually riddled with guilt.

Guilt represents death just as love represents life.

It is because of our own inner innocence that we have brought into all the negativity of the world and allowed it to kill our aliveness, destroy our awareness of who we really are, and sell us the pathetic little smallness for which we have settled.

To recognize this means to be conscious.

Think about it. What does it mean to "raise our consciousness"? To be programmed by other people on how to think?  To get someone else's version of truth?

> Most consciousness programs boil down to this essential point: Become aware of what we are buying into, and what we are accepting daily.

Similar to what Scott Adams echos, "humans are moist computers"; we are blank slates ready to be reprogrammed at any time.

We are the innocent space in which the program is occurring.

When we look at all of this, we are going to get angry; anger is better than apathy, depression, or even grief!

You're depressed because you accepting someone else's programming that life is bad! Get angry at yourself for falling for the scam, and get going!

> It means to take charge of our minds instead of handing it to whatever media we permit it to program ourselves. Media, people, hallway conversations, background noise. It's all garbage in, garbage out. Be ruthless with whom you permit to enter into your consciousness.

We will enjoy starting to let the feelings come up, seeing them for what they actually are, clearing out all the garbage, and letting it all go.

> It's time to re-own our own power and stop giving it away to every passing scammer who jingles our fears and shakes loose our energy. 

Side note: this is just like when the business girl on twitter posted the worst side of Paris riot, claiming this was the future. It does not apply to me.

As the quantity of guilty fear, and the energy that accompanies it, are relinquished, we will notice that physical diseases and symptoms begin to disappear.

Remember: most hospital beds are filled due to EII--Emotionally Induced Illness.

The capacity to love ourselves in the form of increased self-esteem returns and with it comes the capacity to love others.

We become aware of all the guilt-mongers in life, and ask ourselves: "could we not achieve the same result out of love, rather than fear and guilt?"

Is guilt the only reason why we don't stab our neighbors?

# Chapter 7: Desire

## Summary

If you desire something, then you admit that it is outside of your and something you must work to obtain. Desire blocks receiving and results in fear of not getting. The energy of desire is, in essence, a denial that what we want is ours for the asking.

Although the world may appear stingy and hostile towards other people, there is zero reason why we should buy into this paradigm. (remember the second law of consciousness? We are only subject to a negative thought or belief if we *consciously* say that it *applies* to us). It's a shift in our we label the universe. 

Totally surrendering desire means being okay if you finally obtain the goal, **AND** being okay if you *never* obtain the goal. It's being content with your inner self, understanding that it's not the external world that builds us up, but our inner work. It means giving up the sentimental idea of self-sacrifice, pain, and suffering that comes with achieving goals.

Just choose to *be* that person and let go of the block of desiring to be that way.

The way we become that exciting person whom people want to know is to simply *picture*, in your mind, the kind of person we want to be and surrender all the negative feelings and blocks that prevent us from being that.

"What we hold in mind tends to manifest"

## Notes

Here again, the essential point of freedom is whether we have chosen **consciously** to fulfill a certain want, or whether we are being blindly run by **unconscious** programs and beliefs.

### Desire as an obstacle

The main illusion we fall victim to is the following statement:
"The only way I'll get what I want is by *desiring* it; if I let go of my desires, then I won't get what I want"

The reality is, the reverse is true: desire can preclude our attempt to actually obtain that which we seek.

Why? Because the way something comes into our life is because we have chosen it. It was the result of intention. The desiring was actually the obstacle to its achievement.

With intention, we can achieve that which we sought out to get, *in spite of* desire.

To say you desire something means you are not already in possession of it.

Desire blocks receiving and results in fear of not getting. The energy of desire is, in essence, a denial that what we want is ours for the asking.

This is in contradiction with the classical programming of the world. We are used to associating hard work with classical "Protestant work ethic"--qualities such as self-sacrifice, asceticism, will power, effort, etc.

What the author suggests instead is to operate in a freer state: acknowledge nonjudgmeltally and let go of desire. In a freer state, that which is chosen manifests in our life effortlessly. We surrender the desire of emotion and surrender the resistance to merely picturing ourselves already achieving our goal, and allowing it to happen because we see that it is already ours.

> It's a shift in our we label the universe. 

For some people, they view the universe as negative and reluctant, and they therefore reap that which they sow. On the other hand, those on a freer state who operate at a higher level of consciousness, view the universe as loving, giving, and unconditionally approving--is is ours for the asking.

Although the world may appear stingy and hostile towards other people, there is zero reason why we should buy into this paradigm. (remember the second law of consciousness? We are only subject to a negative thought or belief if we *consciously* say that it *applies* to us).

Totally surrendering desire means being okay if you finally obtain the goal, **AND** being okay if you *never* obtain the goal. It's being content with your inner self, understanding that it's not the external world that builds us up, but our inner work.

It means giving up the sentimental idea of self-sacrifice, pain, and suffering that comes with achieving goals.

Society especially will fight this. If we suddenly becomes successful almost effortlessly, people are programmed to be envious. It really annoys them that we didn't have to go through anguish, pain, and suffering to get here. They *want* to believe that success must come at the cost of pain and suffering.

### Having--Doing--Being

The general progression of the levels of consciousness, from lowest to highest, is to move from: (1) havingness (2) doingness (3) beingness

At the lower levels of consciousness, it is what we *have* that counts:
- it is what we *have* that we desire
- it is what we *have* that we value
- it is what we *have* that gives us our self-image of worth and position in the world

Once our basic needs are fulfilled, we have the power to provide for the needs of others and our dependents; the mind begins to becomes more interested in *doing*.

It's at this point that we begin to move to a different social set, in which what we *do* in the world is the basis for our value and how others rate us.

As our consciousness grows, we see that loving service to others automatically results in fulfillment of our own needs (this does not mean sacrifice; service is not the same as sacrifice).

People now seek our company; not because of what we *have*, not because of what we *do*, but because of what we have *become*.

Because of the quality of our presence, people just want to be around us and experience us. We become described as a charismatic person.

This level of beingness is typical of self-help groups. 

In self-help groups, no one is interested in what others do in the world or what they have. They are only interested in whether or not we have achieved certain inner goals (honesty, openness, sharing, lovingness, willingness, humility, etc.)

### Glamour

If we begin to look at something we want, we begin to distinguish between the thing itself versus its *glamour*--we observe nonjudgementally the disparity between what a thing is, in it of itself, and the *glamour* that we have attached to it, which leads to disillusionment.

This happens frequently, when we chase a goal, finally achieve it, and then realize how futile that chase was compared to what we get.

Why does this happen? Glamour. The thing itself does not coincide with out pictures of it.

The man who works a corporate job just to get to the top is upset when he realizes that he does not get admiration, but instead, a whole bag of viciousness, competition, envy, and dishonest manipulation that occur to people in power, including paranoid attacks by competitors. He finds that his energy is so drained that he has no energy left over for his personal life; his relationships are impaired. At the end of it all, when he retires or passes away, no one will even remember who previously held his position.

This is exactly what is in line with what Earl Nightgale speaks of:

Just choose to *be* that person and let go of the block of desiring to be that way.

The way we become that exciting person whom people want to know is to simply *picture*, in your mind, the kind of person we want to be and surrender all the negative feelings and blocks that prevent us from being that.

"What we hold in mind tends to manifest"

### The power of Inner Decision

Your belief system is everything; never sell yourself short.

What do we mean by this? It means catching your habitual self limiting beliefs and transcending them.

You're not "awkward"--you simply have not practiced charisma enough. In this phrasing, the opportunity to become a people's magnet is within your reach if your surrender your limiting beliefs that it's beyond you and accept the belief that you can change. 

> Our mind is so powerful that, if we hold in mind a single negative or self-limiting belief (e.g. "my relationships never workout", "I'm always so awkward", "I get anxious"), then that is most likely going to happen in our life.

The corollary is obviously true:

> If our mind, by its decision, has the power to make negative things happen in our life, then it has equal power in the opposite, positive direction.



# Chapter 8: Anger

## Summary

## Notes

### Using Anger Positively

Byproduct of anger is action--it can either be used constructively for our good or destructively for our downfall.

### Self-Sacrifice

That which we want, desire, and insist upon from another person is felt by them as pressure. (this applies to dating as well!). They will, unconsciously resist. The resistance is because pressure is always felt by us as a denial of choice--we don't want to feel obligated to do shit!

> So, the issue with discipline, is that it can lead to self-sacrifice, and self-sacrifice can lead to pride, and pride can lead to entitlement, and this entitlement is felt as pressure on the other person. It's all vanity. We have a certain secrete vanity about what we are doing for others, and our pride of achievements makes us vulnerable to anger when our "sacrifice" is not recognized.

In addition to perspective, the way out of this type of anger is to radically change how we view what we do for others--a gift, with no strings attached, given from our overflowing cup of abundance. 

We can choose to experience the joy of being generous with others as its own reward.
