# Preface and Foreword
## Notes
> This is the universal message of every great teacher, sage, and saint: "the kingdom of heaven is within you"

No single group of system owns inner peace, for it belongs to the human spirit, by virtue of our origin.

> The major requirement for the journey is a willingness to let go of the attachment to your current experience of life.

Much of our suffering comes from clinging onto what is familiar, despite how much it hurts.

There is a small "self" (as opposed to the actual "Self"--capital S), that *enjoys*:
- impoverishment
- negativity
- being judgemental
- insecurity
- the "need" to be right
- grieving the past
- fearing the future
- craving assurance
- seeking love, instead of giving love
- self-fulfilling pessimism

Meanwhile, the Self that is actually us is waiting to be discovered, so that we may have:
- effortless success
- freedom from resentment
- gratitude for all that has happened to us
- joy
- creative expression
- win-win resolutions
- enriching optimism


It takes courage and self-honesty to see the negativity and the small self that resides within us.

Only after we have acknowledge the negativity that we're inherited from the human condition will we have the possibility to surrender and be free of it.

We simply need to be willing to acknowledge and accept that part of our human existence. 

By accepting it, we transcend it.

The mind, with its thoughts, is driven by feelings, and each feeling is the cumulative derivation of many of thousands of thoughts.

> Because most people repress, suppress, and try to escape from their feelings, the suppressed energy accumulates and seeks expression through psychosomatic distress, bodily disorders, emotional illness, and behavioral and interpersonal issues.

The accumulated feelings block spiritual growth and awareness.

Side note: This is exactly what Michale Singer talks about in his book, ["The Untethered Soul"](https://bookswithalex.com/posts/the-untethered-soul/) 

Here are the improvements we see when we let go:
1. **Behavioral**: There is less and less need for escapism via drugs, alcohol, entertainment, or excessive sleep.
    - Consequently, there is an increase in vitality, energy, presence, and well-being
2. **Physical**: Physical disorders resolve themselves with a change in attitude
3. **Interpersonal Relationships**: An increase capacity to love. Conflicts with others decrease while job performance increases.
    - self-sabotaging behaviors arising from guilt progressively subside
    - **THERE IS LESS AND LESS DEPENDENCE ON INTELLECTUALISM AND A GREATER USE OF INTUITIVE KNOWINGNESS**


# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Summary

## Notes

The chapter opens us with so many hard truths that other people, including myself, have done to "find" that process--yoga, mediation, Jungian studies, acupuncture, fasting, etc.

Confusion is our salvation, for in the confused state, there is still hope. Confusion is the antithesis to other people's answers and ideas. As long as you are confused, you are "free".

But we reach clarity not by seeking something "out there", but rather by undoing the basis of the problem itself--the root issue from within.

It's your own freedom which you have forgotten and don't know how to experience.

Side note: This idea of "we have forgotten something innate" is mentioned in the book, ["The Inner Game of Tennis"](https://bookswithalex.com/posts/the-inner-game-of-tennis/)

What is being offered to you is not something that has to be *acquired* nor obtained externally. It's nothing new either.

> It is already yours and merely has to be reawakened and rediscovered.
