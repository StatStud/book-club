# Preface and Foreword
## Notes
> This is the universal message of every great teacher, sage, and saint: "the kingdom of heaven is within you"

No single group of system owns inner peace, for it belongs to the human spirit, by virtue of our origin.

> The major requirement for the journey is a willingness to let go of the attachment to your current experience of life.

Much of our suffering comes from clinging onto what is familiar, despite how much it hurts.

There is a small "self" (as opposed to the actual "Self"--capital S), that *enjoys*:
- impoverishment
- negativity
- being judgemental
- insecurity
- the "need" to be right
- grieving the past
- fearing the future
- craving assurance
- seeking love, instead of giving love
- self-fulfilling pessimism

Meanwhile, the Self that is actually us is waiting to be discovered, so that we may have:
- effortless success
- freedom from resentment
- gratitude for all that has happened to us
- joy
- creative expression
- win-win resolutions
- enriching optimism


It takes courage and self-honesty to see the negativity and the small self that resides within us.

Only after we have acknowledge the negativity that we're inherited from the human condition will we have the possibility to surrender and be free of it.

We simply need to be willing to acknowledge and accept that part of our human existence. 

By accepting it, we transcend it.

The mind, with its thoughts, is driven by feelings, and each feeling is the cumulative derivation of many of thousands of thoughts.

> Because most people repress, suppress, and try to escape from their feelings, the suppressed energy accumulates and seeks expression through psychosomatic distress, bodily disorders, emotional illness, and behavioral and interpersonal issues.

The accumulated feelings block spiritual growth and awareness.

Side note: This is exactly what Michale Singer talks about in his book, ["The Untethered Soul"](https://bookswithalex.com/posts/the-untethered-soul/) 

Here are the improvements we see when we let go:
1. **Behavioral**: There is less and less need for escapism via drugs, alcohol, entertainment, or excessive sleep.
    - Consequently, there is an increase in vitality, energy, presence, and well-being
2. **Physical**: Physical disorders resolve themselves with a change in attitude
3. **Interpersonal Relationships**: An increase capacity to love. Conflicts with others decrease while job performance increases.
    - self-sabotaging behaviors arising from guilt progressively subside
    - **THERE IS LESS AND LESS DEPENDENCE ON INTELLECTUALISM AND A GREATER USE OF INTUITIVE KNOWINGNESS**


# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Summary

The answer you seek is within you, and ready to be re-discovered

## Notes

The chapter opens us with so many hard truths that other people, including myself, have done to "find" that process--yoga, mediation, Jungian studies, acupuncture, fasting, etc.

Confusion is our salvation, for in the confused state, there is still hope. Confusion is the antithesis to other people's answers and ideas. As long as you are confused, you are "free".

But we reach clarity not by seeking something "out there", but rather by undoing the basis of the problem itself--the root issue from within.

It's your own freedom which you have forgotten and don't know how to experience.

Side note: This idea of "we have forgotten something innate" is mentioned in the book, ["The Inner Game of Tennis"](https://bookswithalex.com/posts/the-inner-game-of-tennis/)

What is being offered to you is not something that has to be *acquired* nor obtained externally. It's nothing new either.

> It is already yours and merely has to be reawakened and rediscovered.

# Chapter 2: The Mechanism of Letting Go

## Summary

The mechanism of letting go is the choice to release pressure, consciously and frequently, at will the moment we become aware of the pressure buildup; pressure comes as a result of involuntary reactivity. The process is just like those outlined in Michale Singer's book and The Inner Game of Tennis: **observe nonjudementally, and then let it pass while remaining open.**

The real source of stress is actually internal, by how we choose to interpret events, for it is not the *external* stimulus that is cause of stress, but our degree of *internal* reactivity. 

The great value in knowing how to surrender and let go is that any and all feelings can be let go at any time, any place, **in an instant**, consciously and effortlessly, independent of external substances, people, or events. The reward is a sudden realization  that we never needed all those thoughts after all. Instead, we are the space between those thoughts, and everything we ever need to know is already known within us.

This is why warriors are those who can handle seemingly stressful events with such inner calmness through a center of strength from within. All the great teachers, from Jesus to Buddha, have asked us to look within ourselves.

## Notes

> The technique is releasing pressure consciously and frequently at will; pressure that comes as a result of involuntary reactivity.

All of man's problems arise because he cannot sit still for 30 minutes alone with his own thoughts.

But it is not the thoughts or facts that make us uneasy, but how we choose to interpret those facts and the resulting feeling that arises from that choice. Thoughts and facts are painless and neutral by themselves.

> It is the accumulated pressure of feelings that causes thoughts.

According to neuroscientist Gray LaViiolette, thoughts are filed in the memory bank according to the various shades of feelings associated with those thoughts

> That's why we learn best when we mix lessons with emotions.

The great value in knowing how to surrender is that any and all feelings can be let go at any time, any place, **in an instant**, consciously and effortlessly.

This means we don't need food, caffeine, alcohol, or any other external substance to get out of our own head.

> So, what is this **surrendered state**? It's a state free of negative feelings in a given area so that creativity and spontaneity can manifest without opposition or the interference of inner conflicts.

Side note: Michale Singer wrote a book called "The Surrender Experiment". I have not read it yet, but I wonder how it relates to this idea.

> To be free of inner conflict and expectations is to give others in our life the greatest freedom. It allows us to experience the basic nature of the universe, which will be discovered, is **to manifest the greatest good possible in a situation**.

### Feelings and Mental Mechanisms

We have three ways of handling feelings:
1. suppression/repression
    - repression is done unconsciously, while suppression is done consciously
    - arising from social and societal customs
    - suppression creates unneeded tension that leads to completely avoidable health complications
    - Feelings are commonly repressed through denial and projection; we maintain our self-esteem at the expense of others
2. expression
    - expression **DOES NOT** free you from emotions; it actually gives the emotion more energy
    - Just enough negative feelings are released; the rest of the negatives are repressed
    - leads to self-indulgence at the expense of others
    - Often a misinterpretation of what Freud emphasized, which is the neutralization, sublimation, and socialization of negative feelings that are then channeled into constructive drives of love, work, and creativity
    - but dumping our negative feelings on others, even therapists, is simply an expression of complaining, which is self-reinforcing and does not build a heroic narrative
3. escape
    - classic avoidance through vices or even workaholic traits
    - people want to stay unconscious to avoid the negatives because they are terrified to face themselves; they cannot handle being alone
    - The effect is the inability to truly love and trust other people, resulting in emotional isolation and self-hatred (think Gaby)

### Feelings and Stress

The real source of stress is actually internal, by how we choose to interpret events.

The more fear we have on the inside, the more our perception of the world is charged with fear. How we view the world is how the world reacts to us.

- to the fearful person, the world is a terrifying place
- to the angry person, the world is a chaos of frustration 
- to the guilty person, the world is a pit of temptation and sin

> what we are holding inside colors our world.

> It is not the external stimulus that is cause of stress, but our degree of reactivity.

That's why people who find comfort in the uncomfortable have great resilience.

### Life events and emotions

Again, thoughts create our destiny:
- the person with a lot of repressed grief will unconsciously create sad events
- the fearful person precipitates frightening experiences
- the angry person becomes surrounded by infuriating circumstances
- the prideful person is constantly being insulted

All the great teachers, from Jesus to Buddha, have asked us to look within ourselves.

Because emotions emit a vibration energy, they affect and determine the people who are in our lives. Life events become influenced by our repressed and suppressed emotions on the physic level (e.g. anger attracts anger thoughts, anger thoughts attract anger actions, anger actions attract anger circumstances).

> like attracts like.

The rich get richer and the poor get poorer applies to people's state of mind. Ultimately, those who have, get--and we all have it, but few choose to get it.

Those with a prosperity complex bring abundance to their lives.

### The Mechanism of Letting Go

Letting go involves:
1. being aware of a feeling
2. letting it come up
3. staying with it
4. letting it run its course and pass through you

It's the exact same idea behind Michale Singer's idea of letting the feeling pass through you with openness. The first step is to allow yourself to experience the emotion without:
- fighting it
- condemning it
- fearing it
- moralizing it

> It means to observe **nonjudgementally**, and regard it as just another wave of emotion

To be sure, the best way to fail with the mechanism is to use any of the negative techniques such as (1) repression/suppression (2) expression (3) escape

> When you give up resiting or trying to modify the feeling, it will shift to the next feeling and be accompanied by a lighter sensation

And here's why we are motivated/incentivize to follow-through with the mechanism of letting go:

> The reward of letting go is a progressive diminishing of dependance on anything or anyone outside of ourselves.

### Resistance to letting go

Letting go is a natural ability, and it's best done by simply doing it.

Eventually, it will be seen that all thoughts are resistance; they are all images that the mind has made to prevent us from experiencing what actually *is*.

> The **real** Self is the space between the thoughts; the field of silent awareness underneath all thoughts.

If thoughts are the goldfish, then we are the water surrounding the fish.

An example of this is when we are totally absorbed in whatever we're doing; that state of deep work when we don't notice the passing of time. The mind was quiet, and we were simply doing without resistance nor effort. Perhaps busy, but relaxed.

> We suddenly realized that we never needed all those thoughts after all.

> Inside of us, but out of our awareness, is the truth that "I already know everything I need to know", and this happens automatically.

Naturally, there is the fear that, if we let go of our desire for something, then we won't get it.

It is then beneficial to let go of some of the commonly held beliefs:
- we only deserve things through hard work, struggle, sacrifice, and effort
    - Side note: but how does this line-up with Carol Deweck's book, "Mindset"?
- Suffering is beneficial and good for us
- We don't get anything for nothing
- Things that are very simple are not worth much

Letting go of the above psychological barriers will allow an enjoyment of its effortlessness and ease.

# Chapter 3: The Anatomy of Emotions

## Summary

The primary goal of mankind is survival, and it achieves this goal by the mind through the use of emotions. Self-awareness is increased much more rapidly **by observing feelings** rather than thoughts

## Notes

> Simplicity is the hallmark of truth

### The Goal of Survival

> The primary goal of mankind is survival

Every human desire seeks to ensure one's personal survival and survival of one's identified groups (family, friends, community, country, etc).

One of the greatest fears of humans is the loss of the capacity to experience, makes influences people to choose to believe that they are their bodies, and that they need their body to experience life.

It is therefore common for humans to look outside of themselves for the satisfaction of their needs, which leads them to experience themselves as vulnerable because they are insufficient unto themselves.

> The mind is, therefore, a primarily survival mechanism through the use of emotions.

Thoughts are engendered by the emotions, and these reactive emotions become shorthand for thoughts.

Emotions are more basic and primitive than mental processes. *Reason* is the tool the mind uses to achieve its *emotional* needs.

The issue is that these emotions many times are below our awareness, leading to actions taken without a reason.

The simple way to become conscious of the underlying emotional goal behind any action or behavior is by asking yourself, "what for?"

Then, ask again, "what for?", until you get deeper and deeper.

This is very similar to CBT and how we dig deep into the core beliefs.

When you question each logical reason with "what for?" continually, we reveal that there are feelings of insecurity and lack of fulfillment.

Each activity or desire will reveal that the basic goal is to achieve a certain *feeling*.

Think about this! You desire nice things because you want the good feelings that come from it, whether it's
- validation from others
- sexual pleasure
- peace

They're all just feelings.

Emotions are therefore connected with what we *believe* will ensure our survival, not with what *actually* will.

Emotions themselves are actually the cause of the basic fear that drives everyone to seek constantly seek security.

### The Scale of Emotions

Everything emits energy, either positive or negative. In this section, we review the levels of consciousness from the book, "Power versus Force".

Above the level of Courage, people *seek us out* because we give energy to them ("power") and we have good will towards them.

Below the level of Courage, people *avoid us* because we *take* energy from them ("force") and we want to use them for our own material or emotional needs.

### Understanding Emotions

Similar to what was already mentioned in chapter two with Gray-LaViolette, all thoughts are filed in the mind's memory bank under a filing system based upon the associated feeling and its finer gradations.

> There have been scientific observations that **self-awareness is increased** much more rapidly **by observing feelings** rather than thoughts

Why might this be? Because there are thousands of thoughts connected to one emotion, so the understanding of the **underlying emotion** and its correct handling is, therefore, more rewarding and less time-consuming than dealing with one's thoughts.

This section introduced a great illustration of the power of letting go, I'll summarize here:
- Man loses passport a few hours before his trip
- **reactively**, the man *panics*, and begins negative self-talk
- With no victory from the negative self-talk, the man **remembers** to surrender
- The man sits down and asks himself, "What for? **What is the basic feeling that I've been ignoring?**"
    - The man identified that he is acting through guilt, shame, and fear
    - The man realizes that, while missing the plane would suck, the world still continues to function..the man is at peace with his fate
- At peace, the man instantly remembers where he placed the passport
- The man now **responds** with gratitude and happiness


> From the above, we conclude: **letting go** can be **very powerful** in both everyday practical life situations, as well as life crisis when we are bombarded with emotions.
