# Preface and Foreword
## Notes
> This is the universal message of every great teacher, sage, and saint: "the kingdom of heaven is within you"

No single group of system owns inner peace, for it belongs to the human spirit, by virtue of our origin.

> The major requirement for the journey is a willingness to let go of the attachment to your current experience of life.

Much of our suffering comes from clinging onto what is familiar, despite how much it hurts.

There is a small "self" (as opposed to the actual "Self"--capital S), that *enjoys*:
- impoverishment
- negativity
- being judgemental
- insecurity
- the "need" to be right
- grieving the past
- fearing the future
- craving assurance
- seeking love, instead of giving love
- self-fulfilling pessimism

Meanwhile, the Self that is actually us is waiting to be discovered, so that we may have:
- effortless success
- freedom from resentment
- gratitude for all that has happened to us
- joy
- creative expression
- win-win resolutions
- enriching optimism


It takes courage and self-honesty to see the negativity and the small self that resides within us.

Only after we have acknowledge the negativity that we're inherited from the human condition will we have the possibility to surrender and be free of it.

We simply need to be willing to acknowledge and accept that part of our human existence. 

By accepting it, we transcend it.

The mind, with its thoughts, is driven by feelings, and each feeling is the cumulative derivation of many of thousands of thoughts.

> Because most people repress, suppress, and try to escape from their feelings, the suppressed energy accumulates and seeks expression through psychosomatic distress, bodily disorders, emotional illness, and behavioral and interpersonal issues.

The accumulated feelings block spiritual growth and awareness.

Side note: This is exactly what Michale Singer talks about in his book, ["The Untethered Soul"](https://bookswithalex.com/posts/the-untethered-soul/) 

Here are the improvements we see when we let go:
1. **Behavioral**: There is less and less need for escapism via drugs, alcohol, entertainment, or excessive sleep.
    - Consequently, there is an increase in vitality, energy, presence, and well-being
2. **Physical**: Physical disorders resolve themselves with a change in attitude
3. **Interpersonal Relationships**: An increase capacity to love. Conflicts with others decrease while job performance increases.
    - self-sabotaging behaviors arising from guilt progressively subside
    - **THERE IS LESS AND LESS DEPENDENCE ON INTELLECTUALISM AND A GREATER USE OF INTUITIVE KNOWINGNESS**


# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Summary

The answer you seek is within you, and ready to be re-discovered

## Notes

The chapter opens us with so many hard truths that other people, including myself, have done to "find" that process--yoga, mediation, Jungian studies, acupuncture, fasting, etc.

Confusion is our salvation, for in the confused state, there is still hope. Confusion is the antithesis to other people's answers and ideas. As long as you are confused, you are "free".

But we reach clarity not by seeking something "out there", but rather by undoing the basis of the problem itself--the root issue from within.

It's your own freedom which you have forgotten and don't know how to experience.

Side note: This idea of "we have forgotten something innate" is mentioned in the book, ["The Inner Game of Tennis"](https://bookswithalex.com/posts/the-inner-game-of-tennis/)

What is being offered to you is not something that has to be *acquired* nor obtained externally. It's nothing new either.

> It is already yours and merely has to be reawakened and rediscovered.

# Chapter 2: The Mechanism of Letting Go

## Summary

The mechanism of letting go is the choice to release pressure, consciously and frequently, at will the moment we become aware of the pressure buildup; pressure comes as a result of involuntary reactivity. The process is just like those outlined in Michale Singer's book and The Inner Game of Tennis: **observe nonjudementally, and then let it pass while remaining open.**

The real source of stress is actually internal, by how we choose to interpret events, for it is not the *external* stimulus that is cause of stress, but our degree of *internal* reactivity. 

The great value in knowing how to surrender and let go is that any and all feelings can be let go at any time, any place, **in an instant**, consciously and effortlessly, independent of external substances, people, or events. The reward is a sudden realization  that we never needed all those thoughts after all. Instead, we are the space between those thoughts, and everything we ever need to know is already known within us.

This is why warriors are those who can handle seemingly stressful events with such inner calmness through a center of strength from within. All the great teachers, from Jesus to Buddha, have asked us to look within ourselves.

## Notes

> The technique is releasing pressure consciously and frequently at will; pressure that comes as a result of involuntary reactivity.

All of man's problems arise because he cannot sit still for 30 minutes alone with his own thoughts.

But it is not the thoughts or facts that make us uneasy, but how we choose to interpret those facts and the resulting feeling that arises from that choice. Thoughts and facts are painless and neutral by themselves.

> It is the accumulated pressure of feelings that causes thoughts.

According to neuroscientist Gray LaViiolette, thoughts are filed in the memory bank according to the various shades of feelings associated with those thoughts

> That's why we learn best when we mix lessons with emotions.

The great value in knowing how to surrender is that any and all feelings can be let go at any time, any place, **in an instant**, consciously and effortlessly.

This means we don't need food, caffeine, alcohol, or any other external substance to get out of our own head.

> So, what is this **surrendered state**? It's a state free of negative feelings in a given area so that creativity and spontaneity can manifest without opposition or the interference of inner conflicts.

Side note: Michale Singer wrote a book called "The Surrender Experiment". I have not read it yet, but I wonder how it relates to this idea.

> To be free of inner conflict and expectations is to give others in our life the greatest freedom. It allows us to experience the basic nature of the universe, which will be discovered, is **to manifest the greatest good possible in a situation**.

### Feelings and Mental Mechanisms

We have three ways of handling feelings:
1. suppression/repression
    - repression is done unconsciously, while suppression is done consciously
    - arising from social and societal customs
    - suppression creates unneeded tension that leads to completely avoidable health complications
    - Feelings are commonly repressed through denial and projection; we maintain our self-esteem at the expense of others
2. expression
    - expression **DOES NOT** free you from emotions; it actually gives the emotion more energy
    - Just enough negative feelings are released; the rest of the negatives are repressed
    - leads to self-indulgence at the expense of others
    - Often a misinterpretation of what Freud emphasized, which is the neutralization, sublimation, and socialization of negative feelings that are then channeled into constructive drives of love, work, and creativity
    - but dumping our negative feelings on others, even therapists, is simply an expression of complaining, which is self-reinforcing and does not build a heroic narrative
3. escape
    - classic avoidance through vices or even workaholic traits
    - people want to stay unconscious to avoid the negatives because they are terrified to face themselves; they cannot handle being alone
    - The effect is the inability to truly love and trust other people, resulting in emotional isolation and self-hatred (think Gaby)

### Feelings and Stress

The real source of stress is actually internal, by how we choose to interpret events.

The more fear we have on the inside, the more our perception of the world is charged with fear. How we view the world is how the world reacts to us.

- to the fearful person, the world is a terrifying place
- to the angry person, the world is a chaos of frustration 
- to the guilty person, the world is a pit of temptation and sin

> what we are holding inside colors our world.

> It is not the external stimulus that is cause of stress, but our degree of reactivity.

That's why people who find comfort in the uncomfortable have great resilience.

### Life events and emotions

Again, thoughts create our destiny:
- the person with a lot of repressed grief will unconsciously create sad events
- the fearful person precipitates frightening experiences
- the angry person becomes surrounded by infuriating circumstances
- the prideful person is constantly being insulted

All the great teachers, from Jesus to Buddha, have asked us to look within ourselves.

Because emotions emit a vibration energy, they affect and determine the people who are in our lives. Life events become influenced by our repressed and suppressed emotions on the physic level (e.g. anger attracts anger thoughts, anger thoughts attract anger actions, anger actions attract anger circumstances).

> like attracts like.

The rich get richer and the poor get poorer applies to people's state of mind. Ultimately, those who have, get--and we all have it, but few choose to get it.

Those with a prosperity complex bring abundance to their lives.

### The Mechanism of Letting Go

Letting go involves:
1. being aware of a feeling
2. letting it come up
3. staying with it
4. letting it run its course and pass through you

It's the exact same idea behind Michale Singer's idea of letting the feeling pass through you with openness. The first step is to allow yourself to experience the emotion without:
- fighting it
- condemning it
- fearing it
- moralizing it

> It means to observe **nonjudgementally**, and regard it as just another wave of emotion

To be sure, the best way to fail with the mechanism is to use any of the negative techniques such as (1) repression/suppression (2) expression (3) escape

> When you give up resiting or trying to modify the feeling, it will shift to the next feeling and be accompanied by a lighter sensation

And here's why we are motivated/incentivize to follow-through with the mechanism of letting go:

> The reward of letting go is a progressive diminishing of dependance on anything or anyone outside of ourselves.

### Resistance to letting go

Letting go is a natural ability, and it's best done by simply doing it.

Eventually, it will be seen that all thoughts are resistance; they are all images that the mind has made to prevent us from experiencing what actually *is*.

> The **real** Self is the space between the thoughts; the field of silent awareness underneath all thoughts.

If thoughts are the goldfish, then we are the water surrounding the fish.

An example of this is when we are totally absorbed in whatever we're doing; that state of deep work when we don't notice the passing of time. The mind was quiet, and we were simply doing without resistance nor effort. Perhaps busy, but relaxed.

> We suddenly realized that we never needed all those thoughts after all.

> Inside of us, but out of our awareness, is the truth that "I already know everything I need to know", and this happens automatically.

Naturally, there is the fear that, if we let go of our desire for something, then we won't get it.

It is then beneficial to let go of some of the commonly held beliefs:
- we only deserve things through hard work, struggle, sacrifice, and effort
    - Side note: but how does this line-up with Carol Deweck's book, "Mindset"?
- Suffering is beneficial and good for us
- We don't get anything for nothing
- Things that are very simple are not worth much

Letting go of the above psychological barriers will allow an enjoyment of its effortlessness and ease.

# Chapter 3: The Anatomy of Emotions

## Summary

We start this chapter by first uncovering the primary goal of mankind, which is that of survival (both personal survival and survival of one's identified group, community, and members). The mind learns so that it can survive to the next generation. Consequently, our minds have adapted to use emotions as shorthands for thoughts by using reason to achieve emotional needs. Each activity or desire will reveal that the basic goal is to achieve a certain feeling (validation, pleasure, peace, etc.). Emotions are therefore connected with what we *believe* will ensure our survival, not with what *actually* will.

This then leads us to ask: How can we overcome our emotions to heal from life crises and past traumas? 

The answer is simple: Start by non-judgementally *observing* your negative emotions, then choosing to let them go by *surrendering* and asking "what am I feeling this way for?", and then, discover *within yourself* the opposite positive emotions that represent the greatness that lives within you. Letting go of negative feelings, and surrendering to positive ones.

When the fear of one of the smaller emotional units is acknowledged and released, all the alternative positive possibilities that exist will becomes suddenly apparent. Mastery of letting it go is mastery over fear, and the unblocking of whole avenues of life experiences that previously had been avoided due to self-imposed inhibitions from fear.

Self-awareness is increased much more rapidly by observing feelings rather than thoughts. When that inner emptiness, due to lack of self-worth, is replaced by true self-love, self-respect, and esteem, we no longer have to seek it in the world, for that source of happiness is **within ourselves**.

## Notes

> Simplicity is the hallmark of truth

### The Goal of Survival

> The primary goal of mankind is survival

Every human desire seeks to ensure one's personal survival and survival of one's identified groups (family, friends, community, country, etc).

One of the greatest fears of humans is the loss of the capacity to experience, makes influences people to choose to believe that they are their bodies, and that they need their body to experience life.

It is therefore common for humans to look outside of themselves for the satisfaction of their needs, which leads them to experience themselves as vulnerable because they are insufficient unto themselves.

> The mind is, therefore, a primarily survival mechanism through the use of emotions.

Thoughts are engendered by the emotions, and these reactive emotions become shorthand for thoughts.

Emotions are more basic and primitive than mental processes. *Reason* is the tool the mind uses to achieve its *emotional* needs.

The issue is that these emotions many times are below our awareness, leading to actions taken without a reason.

The simple way to become conscious of the underlying emotional goal behind any action or behavior is by asking yourself, "what for?"

Then, ask again, "what for?", until you get deeper and deeper.

This is very similar to CBT and how we dig deep into the core beliefs.

When you question each logical reason with "what for?" continually, we reveal that there are feelings of insecurity and lack of fulfillment.

Each activity or desire will reveal that the basic goal is to achieve a certain *feeling*.

Think about this! You desire nice things because you want the good feelings that come from it, whether it's
- validation from others
- sexual pleasure
- peace

They're all just feelings.

Emotions are therefore connected with what we *believe* will ensure our survival, not with what *actually* will.

Emotions themselves are actually the cause of the basic fear that drives everyone to seek constantly seek security.

### The Scale of Emotions

Everything emits energy, either positive or negative. In this section, we review the levels of consciousness from the book, "Power versus Force".

Above the level of Courage, people *seek us out* because we give energy to them ("power") and we have good will towards them.

Below the level of Courage, people *avoid us* because we *take* energy from them ("force") and we want to use them for our own material or emotional needs.

### Understanding Emotions

Similar to what was already mentioned in chapter two with Gray-LaViolette, all thoughts are filed in the mind's memory bank under a filing system based upon the associated feeling and its finer gradations.

> There have been scientific observations that **self-awareness is increased** much more rapidly **by observing feelings** rather than thoughts

Why might this be? Because there are thousands of thoughts connected to one emotion, so the understanding of the **underlying emotion** and its correct handling is, therefore, more rewarding and less time-consuming than dealing with one's thoughts.

This section introduced a great illustration of the power of letting go, I'll summarize here:
- Man loses passport a few hours before his trip
- **reactively**, the man *panics*, and begins negative self-talk
- With no victory from the negative self-talk, the man **remembers** to surrender
- The man sits down and asks himself, "What for? **What is the basic feeling that I've been ignoring?**"
    - The man identified that he is acting through guilt, shame, and fear
    - The man realizes that, while missing the plane would suck, the world still continues to function..the man is at peace with his fate
- At peace, the man instantly remembers where he placed the passport
- The man now **responds** with gratitude and happiness


> From the above, we conclude: **letting go** can be **very powerful** in both everyday practical life situations, as well as life crisis when we are bombarded with emotions.


### Handling Emotional Crises

Recall from the previous chapter that the mind unconsciously uses suppression/repression, expression, and escape to handle emotional crises.

These techniques, when used consciously, can actually be useful by disassembling the emotion into smaller peaces so it's easier to let go, piece-by-piece. But the key word here is *consciously* and *sparingly*.

Thus, in the event of a crises, it may perfectly fine to *consciously* push away as much of the emotion we are capable of at the current moment, especially if it's an overwhelming crises.

> Every strong emotion is really comprised of a number of smaller, less complex emotional units that can be disassembled.

When the fear of one of the smaller emotional units is acknowledged and released, all the alternative possibilities that exist will becomes suddenly apparent.

As the disassembled emotional complex is taken apart into its emotional units, each emotional unit now has less energy and can be surrendered individually, rather than being overwhelmed with so many emotions.

Handling a crisis from the emotional standpoint, rather than the intellectual one, will shorten its duration dramatically.

Think about it: if someone loses a job, handling the loss from an intellectual standpoint will produce thousands of hypothetical situations and worse-case scenarios, producing sleepless nights.

Until the underlying emotion is surrendered, the thoughts will be engendered endlessly.

There are numerous benefits to handling a life crises successfully; the feeling of self-esteem and greater awareness gives confidence in one knowing that he can survive and handle whatever life brings.

There is an overall reduction of the fear of life, a greater feeling of mastery, compassion for the suffering of others, and increased ability to help them through similar circumstances.

### Healing the Past

Another emotional technique to deal with unresolved issues, especially those from the past, is to place the event in a different context.

That is, see it from a different perspective through a different meaning. This is one of the most effective tools for handling the past.

All we have to do is give it a different meaning.

> We take on a different attitude about the past difficulty or trauma, and we acknowledge the hidden gift in it

Side note: This is exactly what happened with Lauren. Although the project did not end well, I found a new band of people worth working with.

This idea of reframing the past is endorsed by Viktor Frankl (Logotherapy).

> "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing, the last of the human freedoms: to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances." --Viktor Frankl

> Every life experience, no matter how tragic, contains a hidden gem of a lesson

> All forbidden impulses, thoughts, feelings, and actions can be resolved with iterative probing of "so what?".

Fear of life is really the fear of emotions.

It is not the facts that we fear but our feelings about them.

So, once we have mastery over our feelings, our fear of life diminishes.

How do we master our feelings? Start by first nonjudgmentally observing them, then, let them go. It's that simple.

> Fear is the bias of all inhibitions. Mastery over fear means the unblocking of whole avenues of life experiences that previously had been avoided.

Thus, the man who successfully handles the crisis of losing a job will never again experience the same fear.

Instead, he will actually be far more creative, taking new risks, and earning higher success in life.

He will witness how the haunting fear of job loss had severely limited his performance in the past year, made him fearful and cautious, and cost him self-esteem due to his compliance with his superiors.

Another benefit of a life-crisis is greater self-awareness. This is because we are forced to take a good look at our life situation and re-evaluate our beliefs, goals, values, and life direction. It is an opportunity to let go of guilt and have a total shift in our attitude.

> The part of us that wants to cling to negative emotions is our smallest self.

> The world can only see us as we see ourselves.

Picture yourself as being generous, forgiving, loving, and experiencing your inner greatness. **Instantly** there will be an enormous increase in muscle strength as a result of positive bio-energy.

Smallest on the other hand (picturing yourself as mean, petty, cheap, etc) brings sickness, disease, weakness, and death.

Letting go will help the stopping of negative emotions.

### Enhancing Positive Emotions

> The corollary to letting go of negative feelings is to stop resisting the positive ones.

Whenever we experience negative emotions, it's quite helpful to imagine the positive opposite version, and practice letting go.

Here's an example (personal one): Imagine Lauren scheduled a 1:1 with you. You may start feeling fear, resentment, hatred, trapped. The opposite of those feelings would be courage, admiration,love, and free.

We can **look within ourselves** for those positive opposites emotions--courage, admiration, love, and free-will, and stop resisting them.

We then realize that part of our nature has always been willing to be positive--to be courageous, loving, respectful, and enthusiastic, but we didn't give it a chance. 

> We instead thought we were punishing the other person by holding the resentment, but we have actually been repressing love.


> The purpose of this exercise is to locate within ourselves that which can only be described as **greatness**

Greatness is the courage to overcome obstacles. It is the willingness to move to a higher level of love. It is the acceptance of other's humanness and having compassion for their suffering.

With this increased awareness of who we really are comes the progressive invulnerability of pain.

> Out of the recognition of who we really are comes the desire to seek that which is uplifting, out of which arises a new meaning and context for life.

> When that inner emptiness, due to lack of self-worth, is replaced by true self-love, self-respect, and esteem, we no longer have to seek it in the world, for that source of happiness is **within ourselves**.

It dawns on us that it cannot be supplied by the world anyway.

When we use these techniques of relinquishing the negative and surrendering the positive, we come into a sudden, comprehensive awareness of our true dimension.

Once this has been experienced, it will never be forgotten. The world will never intimidate us again as it once did.

Outwardly, the behavior may appear the same, but inwardly, the causes for it are now totally different.

We go through life balanced and graceful.

# Chapter 4: Apathy and Depression

## Summary

## Notes

### I can't versus I won't

The biological purpose of apathy is to summon aid. Apathy indicates a lack of life energy and closeness to death.

The way out of apathy is to *remind* ourselves of our intentions, which is to get higher and freer--to become more effective and happy, and to let go of the resistance to the technique itself.

It's reminding does not help, simply look at the current fruits that apathy yields in your life--are you happy with those fruits? It's your choice.

Most "I can't" are often:
- "I won't"
- "I'm afraid to"
- "I have too much pride to try, for fear I may fail"

Behind the "I won't" is a reason "...because I am afraid". That is how we move upwards from apathy to fear in the consciousness map.

Fear is a higher energy level than apathy. Fear at least begins to motivate us into action.

Apathy is merely a veneer for fear.

There was such a good, detailed description of the typical self-improvement path of many people, that I decided to include the whole section here:

![](/letting-go1.png)

This is the power of self-help groups: the sharing of inner experiences, from the lowest to the highest levels on the scale of emotions.

> What does it mean to become more conscious?

To begin with, it means to start looking for the truth for ourselves, rather than blindly subscribing to whatever we're programmed to follow by media or society.

Becoming more conscious means accepting greater responsibility for what we choose to take personally into our psyche. We ultimately begin to realize that we have a choice.

We can stop giving authority to all of the mind's thoughts, and begin to question them, and find out if there is really any truth in them for ourselves--it is a questioning of *everything*. 

We learn that doing something new means being willing to let go of pride. We look at the cost as ask, 

> "Am I willing to continue to pay this price? Would I be willing to let go of the fear of not succeeding. Would I be willing to let go of resisting the effort required? Would I be willing to let go of the vanity so that I could allow myself to be awkward as a learner? Could I let go of my stinginess and smallness and be willing to pay for the lessons and give the time?"

> As all of the associated feelings are surrendered, it becomes clear that the real reason is unwillingness--not inadequacy

It must be remembered that we are free to acknowledge and surrender our feelings, and we are free not to surrender. We are perfectly free to refuse to let go.

We are free to hang onto negativity as long as we want, from our own choosing.

We are free agents.

### Blame

Let's first look at what makes blame so appealing.

Blame is the world's greatest excuse. It enables us to remain limited and small without feeling guilty. If we blame others for our troubles, then we get to be the innocent victim and the other party is the bad one; we enjoy the self-pity and the sympathy of others.

But there is a cost: the loss of our freedom.

The role of the victim brings with it a self-perception of weakness, vulnerability, and helplessness, which are the major components to apathy and depression.

The first step out of blame is by nonjudementally observing that we are *choosing* to blame.

The right approach is to forgive, forget, and give new meaning to the context. 

We can see the right approach with Victor Frankl, who chose to forgive the Nazi guards and discover a hidden gift in his experience at the concentration camps.

> **But here's the trick**: We have to be honest and realize that we are blaming because we *choose* to blame. This is true, no matter how *justified* the circumstances may appear to be.

> It is not a matter of right or wrong, bt merely a matter of taking responsibility for our own consciousness, psyche, interpretations, and stories.

To overcome blame, we get to be willing to surrender all of the little payoffs for something far greater.

Depression and apathy result from the **willingness** to hang on the small self and its belief systems, plus the **resistance** to our Higher Self, which consist of all the opposites of the negative feelings.

Who would I become reversed what I was willing to accept and resist?

> Every feeling has its opposite. The way out of negativity is therefore the **willingness** to acknowledge and let go of negative feelings while simultaneously the **willingness** to let go of resisting of their positive opposite.

The tricky thing with blame is that the mind can make up *reasonably sound* justifications. "I don't have time", "I don't deserve to give it up", "I can't forget what she did to me", "she should apologize to me first",etc.

In this case, two things are operating:
1. clinging to negativity and smallness within us
2. resisting the positive and greatest within us

> Here is one of the laws of consciousness: we are only subject to a negative thought or belief if we *consciously* say that it *applies to us*. **We are free to *choose* not to buy into a negative belief system.**

This is life changing. No matter what the media says, whether it's a recession, dating crisis for young men, or the decay of American society, I am free to refuse to buy into the negative thought form.

We can say instead:
- "unemployment does not apply to me"
- "recessions do not apply to me"
- "gender wars do not apply to me"
- "mental sickness does not apply to me"
- "loneness does not apply to me"

> By refusing to accept the negative belief, it now has **zero value** over our life.

If we have power to manifest negativity, then we have power to manifest positivity.

### Choosing the positive

One surprising effect of the willingness to let go of our inner negativity is the discovery that the polar opposite of the negative feelings, the positive, exist.

This is the inner reality that we call our "inner greatness" or "Higher Self".

In return for letting go of the payoffs that we are getting from the negative position, we are now surprised by the positive payoffs that stem from the power of our positive feelings.

One example of this is that when we let go of blame (small self), we surrender to and experience forgiveness (higher self).

When we let go of payoffs from the small self, we experience the **unlimited capacity** that is our higher self.

Our high self can **CREATE**:
- employment opportunities
- situations for the healing of relationships
- opportunities to give and receive love
- empower new financial, health, and well-being goals

This empowerment results in a rise in self-esteem, the return of creativity, and the opening of a positive vision of the future that replaces fearlessness.

If you have trouble practicing positivity, you can tell yourself that you're just doing an experiment, for purpose for which is to learn. The purpose is to also become familiar with the laws of consciousness and witness, in real time, the phenomenon to occur.

> The mind projects on to the future with the expectation that the past will be repeated.

When we discover this unconscious dynamic, we can choose to look again at the emotional complex disassemble it into its emotional units, let go of each negative component, and then let go of the resistance of its positive opposite.

The more we do this, the more our perspective of the future changes, the more the world changes, and the more hwo the world responds to us changes.

Here are some questions to ask yourself when you observe your small self:
- How long am I willing to pay the cost?
- How much blame is enough?
- Is there a time to call an end to it?
- How long will I hang on to it?
- How much shame is enough?
- How much self-punishment is enough?
- When does the sentence come to and end?
- Where has my bitterness taken me?


Now, ask these questions:
- Did school teach me courses on consciousness?
- Did anyone ever tell me that I had freedom to choose what went into my mind?
- Was I ever taught I could refuse all of the negative programming?
- Did anyone ever tell me the laws of consciousness?
- Why not stop beating ourselves up right now?

> We all did what we thought was best in the moment.

### The company we keep

Another valuable technique for overcoming apathy and depression, and the "I can't/I won't" attitudes, is to choose to surround yourself with people who have resolved the issues you're currently facing. **This is one of the great powers of self-help groups.**

Those who are in a higher vibration are free of the energy from their negative thoughts and have energized positive thought forms. To merely be in their presence is beneficial enough.

We are either positively or negatively influenced by the company we keep.
