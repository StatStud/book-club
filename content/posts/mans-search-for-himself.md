## Chapter 1: The Loneliness and Anxiety of Modern Man

Something to keep in mind: This book was published in 1953 (after WWII).

These were the common issues that plagued the US in the 1950s:
- Threat of war
- the draft
- economic uncertainty

And here are the symptoms that May notices among his patients:
- unhappiness
- inability to decide or make decisions (marriage or vocations)
- general despair
- meaninglessness in their lives
- feelings of powerlessness

So, May begins to wonder: **What are the root problems beneath these symptoms?**

### The Hollow Man

In this section, May dives straight into his answer: The chief problem of the people in the middle decade of the twentieth century is **emptiness**.

This is not an issue of people not know what they *want*, rather it's an issue of people not knowing what they *feel*.

According to May, the underlying problem behind people's inability to make decisions is that **they have no definite experience of their own desires or wants**.

A classic example that illustrates this issue is romantic relationships. Ray's patients seem to have an inability to form committed relationships, with some relationships ending prematurely before marriage, and others simply becoming dissatisfied with their partners. So what's the issue? These couples expect the marriage partner, real or hoped-for, to fill some lack, some vacancy within themselves; and they are anxious and angry because he or she doesn't--in other words, their expectations of did not match the reality.

These same people can generally talk fluently about what they **should** want, but it becomes evident that they are describing what others, parents, professors, employers **expect of them rather than what they want for themselves**.

As one patient puts it: "I;m just a collection of mirrors, reflecting what everuone else expects of me".

Naturally, we may begin to point the finger at society; Freud made it clear that secretive desires (e.g. sexual desires) needed to be released from repression and somehow integrated properly into reality. However, even in 1950s, opportunities for sexual gratification could be found with relative ease ("The Pill", or oral contraceptive pill, took off in the years after this book, during the 1960s).

May argues that the sexual problems people brought during his time were rarely struggles against social prohibitions.

So, if social prohibitions were not the issue, what does May claim the real issue was? May claims that these people **suffered from deficiencies from within**; **they lacked potency and the capacity to have strong feelings in responding to the sexual partner**. Sex for so many people is an empty, mechanical, and vacuous experience.

So what is this emptiness that May speaks of? It can generally be regarded as an inability to *know* what one feels or wants. 

So what set of conditions seem to bring about this emptiness that's within people? Again, many people may begin pointing externally, and pointing the finger to the uncertainty of times following post WWII. May acknowledges that indeed, the post-war uncertainty has a rol in this, but that alone would be a shallow explanation.

May believes that the post-war uncertainty, or really *any* time period that faced a major threat to stability, were largely *symptoms* of underlying conditions within our society.


#### May's Evidence: Can we really trust input from therapy patients?
Before May goes deeper into explaining the root cause of this emptiness, he brings up a clarification on his observations. Since many of May's encounters deal with people who voluntarily pursue psychological help, some may argue that perhaps these people are not a representative sample of the entire US health?

In May's defense, he claims the contrary: that those who seek psychological help are often the more sensitive and gifted members of society.

From May's perspective, those who come to his clinic need help because they are less successful at rationalizing than the "well-adjusted" citizen (who is able follow the rules of society while covering up his underlying conflicts).

May illustrates his claim by analyzing the patients who first encountered Freud in the 1890s; during this time, *most people* believed that sex was repugnant and should be covered up as much as possible. Ironically enough, in the years following the first world war, the 1920s experienced an epidemic of overtly sexual problems. And this is perhaps where Freud gets his credibility--his work with his patients enabled him to predict this sexual frustration that followed in the later decades.

Going back to May's defense on the validity of his client's experiences, we now come equipped with the perspective that **a relatively small number of people provide a very revealing and significant barometer of the conflicts and tensions under the psychological surface of society**.

Indeed, this "barometer" should be taken seriously, as it is one of the best indexes of the disruptions and problems which have not yet, but may soon, break out widely in society.

#### May's Evidence: Sociological Data

Outside of the consulting rooms of psychologists and psychoanalysts, May also looked at sociological data. In particular, the book "The Lonely Crowd" by David Riesman discovers his same emptiness before the first world war.

These so-called "gyroscope men", are "inner-directed" and could be detected by the following characteristics:
- Taken over the standards he was taught
- Moralistic in the late Victorian sense
- Strong motives and ambitions that were derived from outside
- Gain strength by 
    - internalizing external rules
    - Compartmentalizing will power and intellect
    - repressing their feelings
- Often well-suited for business success
- Mechanical ("gyroscope" center of stability)
- Rigidity, dogmatism, and inability to learn and to change
- pseudo "inner strength"
- Eventually self-defeating
- "inner direction" a moralistic substitute for integrity rather than integrity itself

These "gyroscope men" lived by the stability of an "inner gyroscope", and were often emotionally repressed people directed by a strong superego. The attitudes and behaviors of these men are examples of how certain attitudes in society tend to crystallize rigidly just before they collapse; a period of emptiness would naturally follow this breakdown of the "iron men".

(Side note: How does this relate to the phrase "strong men, good times; good times, weak men; weak men, bad times; bad times, strong men; and the cycle continues"?)

Personally, the people who come to mind are perhaps the "naturally born" republican kids, who grow up becoming fiercely loyal to an ideology that is strongly directed by environment.

Meanwhile, the people of the 1950s post WWII are described by Riesman as "outer-directed" in that they seek no to stand out, but to *conform* and fit in.

Metaphorically speaking, these "outer-directed" are like "radar men", who constantly scan the environment for how they should act--the same way people with a set of mirrors simply reflect what others wish to see.
- characterized by passivity and apathy
- wish to be accepted by their peers, even to the extent of being inconspicuous and absorbed in the group

#### Back to the main topic

What's the best illustration of the empty man?
- Suburban man
- get up at the same hour every weekday morning
- takes the same train to work
- performs the same task in the office
- lunches at the same place
- leaves the same tip for the waittress each day
- comes home from the same train each night
- has 2.3 children
- cultivates a little garden
- goes to church every Christmas and Easter
- moves through a routine, mechanical existence year after year until he finally retires at 65, and very soon thereafter dies of heart failure possibly brought on by **repressed hostility** (I think Joe Rogan once mentioned a quote that read, "Most men suffer in silence")
- Looks up to the bold people who go outside the lines of society and live on their own terms
    - These "hollow men" endure the monotony only by an occasional blowoff--either from themselves or by identifying with someone else's blowoff

And this widespread emptiness is far more insidious than what we could imagine; widespread drug addictions are just one of those manifested symptoms of this inner emptiness. **The human beng cannot live in a condition of emptiness for very long**: if he is not growing toward something, he does not merely stagnate; the pent-up potentialities turn into morbidity and despairs, and eventually into self-destructive activities.

#### Back to the main question: What causes this source of Emptiness?

The feeling of emptiness generally comes from people's feeling that they are **powerless** to do anything effective about their lives or the world they live in.

Side note: this is perhaps why Jordan Peterson is such a big advocate for people seeking power and to become dangerous--this is a creative force that empowers the individual to direct his life as he chooses.

Inner vacuousness is the long-term, accumulated result of a person's particular conviction toward himself, other people, and the world around him; he believes that he cannot act as an entity in directing his own life, nor change other people's attitude toward him, nor influence the world around him.

Consequently, it is this powerlessness that leads him to despair and futility. Without much action, he begins to feel no real difference, and give sup wanting and feeling, resulting in apathy and lack of feeling as a defense against anxiety. When a persona continually faces dangers he is powerless to overcome, his final line of defense is at last to avoid even feeling the dangers :(

#### What's the big picture impact of emptiness?

When individual emptiness mixes with societal conformity, we get blind mobs of people with no purpose blindly following the next blind person. This calamity makes society at large vulnerable to fascist dictatorships like Nazi Germany to come in and fill in this empty void the same way people seek romantic relationships to fill in the emptiness.
