# Part 1: Our Predicament

## Chapter 1: The Loneliness and Anxiety of Modern Man

### Summary

#### One Sentence Summary

The issues of society are a reflection of man's weak and undeveloped inner strength and self of identity.

#### One paragraph Summary

Rollo May notices a period of high anxiety and existentialism among people of the 1950s; while many would point outward toward WWII, economic depression, and social prohibitions as the cause of this psychological distress, May suggests that these are merely outward symptoms of underlying conditions within our society--specifically at the individual level. These symptoms of anxiety and loneliness are a result of deficiencies from within, rather than social prohibitions--leading to a sense of inner emptiness that people attempt to fill with external social expectations. The result is a group of people who live passively, have trouble deciding on important matters such as marriage and vocations, and a general sense of apathy towards life. May suggest that man has lost touch with what he feels and wants, calling us to begin introspectively asking what we want and living a life that aligns with that desire. Society is beneficial because it grans us social relationships and social roles that help orient us towards our sense of self--problems only arise in extreme conditions when we either derive our strength from conformity or become detached from reality from excessive isolation.

### The Hollow Man

Something to keep in mind: This book was published in 1953 (after WWII).

These were the common issues that plagued the US in the 1950s:
- Threat of war
- the draft
- economic uncertainty

And here are the symptoms that May notices among his patients:
- unhappiness
- inability to decide or make decisions (marriage or vocations)
- general despair
- meaninglessness in their lives
- feelings of powerlessness

So, May begins to wonder: **What are the root problems beneath these symptoms?**

In this section, May dives straight into his answer: The chief problem of the people in the middle decade of the twentieth century is **emptiness**.

This is not an issue of people not knowing what they *want*, rather it's an issue of people not knowing what they *feel*.

According to May, the underlying problem behind people's inability to make decisions is that **they have no definite experience of their own desires or wants**.

A classic example that illustrates this issue is romantic relationships. Ray's patients seem to have an inability to form committed relationships, with some relationships ending prematurely before marriage, and others simply becoming dissatisfied with their partners. So what's the issue? These couples expect the marriage partner, real or hoped-for, to fill some lack, some vacancy within themselves; and they are anxious and angry because he or she doesn't--in other words, their expectations of did not match the reality.

These same people can generally talk fluently about what they **should** want, but it becomes evident that they are describing what others, parents, professors, employers **expect of them rather than what they want for themselves**.

As one patient puts it: "I'm just a collection of mirrors, reflecting what everyone else expects of me".

Naturally, we may begin to point the finger at society; Freud made it clear that secretive desires (e.g. sexual desires) needed to be released from repression and somehow integrated properly into reality. 

However, even in 1950s, opportunities for sexual gratification could be found with relative ease ("The Pill", or oral contraceptive pill, took off in the years after this book, during the 1960s). May argues that the sexual problems people brought during his time were rarely struggles against social prohibitions. So, if social prohibitions were not the issue, what does May claim the real issue was? 

May claims that these people **suffered from deficiencies from within**; **they lacked potency and the capacity to have strong feelings in responding to the sexual partner**. Sex for so many people is an empty, mechanical, and vacuous experience.

So what is this emptiness that May speaks of? It can generally be regarded as an **inability** to *know* what one feels or wants. 

So what set of conditions seem to bring about this emptiness that's within people? Again, many people may begin pointing externally, and pointing the finger to the uncertainty of times following post WWII. May acknowledges that indeed, the post-war uncertainty has a rol in this, but that alone would be a shallow explanation.

May believes that the post-war uncertainty, or really *any* time period that faced a major threat to stability, were largely *symptoms* of underlying conditions within our society.


#### May's Evidence: Can we really trust input from therapy patients?
Before May goes deeper into explaining the root cause of this emptiness, he brings up a clarification on his observations. Since many of May's encounters deal with people who voluntarily pursue psychological help, some may argue that perhaps these people are not a representative sample of the entire US health?

In May's defense, he claims the contrary: that those who seek psychological help are often the more sensitive and gifted members of society.

From May's perspective, those who come to his clinic need help because they are less successful at rationalizing than the "well-adjusted" citizen (who is able follow the rules of society while covering up his underlying conflicts).

May illustrates his claim by analyzing the patients who first encountered Freud in the 1890s; during this time, *most people* believed that sex was repugnant and should be covered up as much as possible. Ironically enough, in the years following the first world war, the 1920s experienced an epidemic of overtly sexual problems. And this is perhaps where Freud gets his credibility--his work with his patients enabled him to predict this sexual frustration that followed in the later decades.

Going back to May's defense on the validity of his client's experiences, we now come equipped with the perspective that **a relatively small number of people provide a very revealing and significant barometer of the conflicts and tensions under the psychological surface of society**.

Indeed, this "barometer" should be taken seriously, as it is one of the best indexes of the disruptions and problems which have not yet, but may soon, break out widely in society.

#### May's Evidence: Sociological Data

Outside of the consulting rooms of psychologists and psychoanalysts, May also looked at sociological data. In particular, the book "The Lonely Crowd" by David Riesman discovers his same emptiness before the first world war.

These so-called "gyroscope men", are "inner-directed" and could be detected by the following characteristics:
- Taken over the standards he was taught
- Moralistic in the late Victorian sense
- Strong motives and ambitions that were derived from outside
- Gain strength by 
    - internalizing external rules
    - Compartmentalizing will power and intellect
    - repressing their feelings
- Often well-suited for business success
- Mechanical ("gyroscope" center of stability)
- Rigidity, dogmatism, and inability to learn and to change
- pseudo "inner strength"
- Eventually self-defeating
- "inner direction" a moralistic substitute for integrity rather than integrity itself

These "gyroscope men" lived by the stability of an "inner gyroscope", and were often emotionally repressed people directed by a strong superego. The attitudes and behaviors of these men are examples of how certain attitudes in society tend to crystallize rigidly just before they collapse; a period of emptiness would naturally follow this breakdown of the "iron men".

(Side note: How does this relate to the phrase "strong men, good times; good times, weak men; weak men, bad times; bad times, strong men; and the cycle continues"?)

Personally, the people who come to mind are perhaps the "naturally born" republican kids, who grow up becoming fiercely loyal to an ideology that is strongly directed by environment.

Meanwhile, the people of the 1950s post WWII are described by Riesman as "outer-directed" in that they seek no to stand out, but to *conform* and fit in.

Metaphorically speaking, these "outer-directed" are like "radar men", who constantly scan the environment for how they should act--the same way people with a set of mirrors simply reflect what others wish to see.
- characterized by passivity and apathy
- wish to be accepted by their peers, even to the extent of being inconspicuous and absorbed in the group

#### What does the empty archetype look like?

What's the best illustration of the empty man?
- Suburban man
- get up at the same hour every weekday morning
- takes the same train to work
- performs the same task in the office
- lunches at the same place
- leaves the same tip for the waitress each day
- comes home from the same train each night
- has 2.3 children
- cultivates a little garden
- goes to church every Christmas and Easter
- moves through a routine, mechanical existence year after year until he finally retires at 65, and very soon thereafter dies of heart failure possibly brought on by **repressed hostility** (I think Joe Rogan once mentioned a quote that read, "Most men suffer in silence")
- Looks up to the bold people who go outside the lines of society and live on their own terms
    - These "hollow men" endure the monotony only by an occasional blowoff--either from themselves or by identifying with someone else's blowoff

And this widespread emptiness is far more insidious than what we could imagine; widespread drug addictions are just one of those manifested symptoms of this inner emptiness. **The human beng cannot live in a condition of emptiness for very long**: if he is not growing toward something, he does not merely stagnate; the pent-up potentialities turn into morbidity and despairs, and eventually into self-destructive activities.

#### Back to the main question: What causes this source of Emptiness?

The feeling of emptiness generally comes from people's feeling that they are **powerless** to do anything effective about their lives or the world they live in.

Side note: this is perhaps why Jordan Peterson is such a big advocate for people seeking power and to become dangerous--this is a creative force that empowers the individual to direct his life as he chooses.

Inner vacuousness is the long-term, accumulated result of a person's particular conviction toward himself, other people, and the world around him; he believes that he cannot act as an entity in directing his own life, nor change other people's attitude toward him, nor influence the world around him.

Consequently, it is this powerlessness that leads him to despair and futility. Without much action, he begins to feel no real difference, and give sup wanting and feeling, resulting in apathy and lack of feeling as a defense against anxiety. When a persona continually faces dangers he is powerless to overcome, his final line of defense is at last to avoid even feeling the dangers :(

#### What's the big picture impact of emptiness?

When individual emptiness mixes with societal conformity, we get blind mobs of people with no purpose blindly following the next blind person. This calamity makes society at large vulnerable to fascist dictatorships like Nazi Germany to come in and fill in this empty void the same way people seek romantic relationships to fill in the emptiness.

### Loneliness

The feelings of emptiness and loneliness go together because they are both a reflection weak inner strength.

#### How do people react when feeling anxious?

For example, when a person does not know with any inner conviction what he wants nor what he feels, as a result of a period of traumatic change, be becomes aware of the fact that the conventional desires and goals he has been taught to follow no longer bring him any security or give him any sense of direction, when, that is, he feels an inner void while he stands amid the outer confusion of upheaved in his society, he senses danger; and his natural **reaction** is to look around for people.

Why does he look outward for other people? Because **he hopes they will give him some sense of direction**, or at least some comfort in the knowledge that he is not alone in his fright. This is really no different than the natural instinct in animals to stick together in hurds, to be protected as one pack.

Emptiness and loneliness are thus **two phases of the same basic experience of anxiety**.

#### What is the purpose of social relations for Man's self?

Author Norman Cousins wrote in his book, "Modern Man Is Obsolete", "All man's history is an endeavor to shatter his loneliness"--or as French philosopher Blaise Pascal would say, "All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone".

Another reason for man's dependance on others is that **the human being gets his original experience of being a self out of his relatedness to other people**; when he is alone, without other persons, he is afraid he will lose his experience of being a self.

Said differently, man receives his consciousness of himself, **which is the basis of his capacity to orient himself in life**, from these relationships. **Part of the feeling of loneliness is that man needs relations with other people in order to orient himself**.

The fear of being alone derives much of its terror from our anxiety lest **we lose our awareness of ourselves**.

In the same way we may lose the distinction between wakefulness and sleep when sleep-deprived, we may lose the distinction between the subjective self and the objective world around us when we are socially deprived.

The people in our lives orient us. Every human being gets much of his sense of his own reality out of what others say to him and think about him.

BUT! The key difference May notes during this time period is one of *extreme* dependence on others for their feeling of reality--to the point where they would fear losing their own sense of existence without the input from others.

This is not to say that isolation is inherently bad, nor to say that socializing is inherently bad either--both qualities can yield great results when balanced correctly, at the right time, while avoiding extremes.

#### The real threat of loneliness

The threat of extreme isolation is psychosis (Side note: I personally experienced this when I lived out in the middle of no where in solitude. The longer I went, the less "human" I stared acting. I would not recommend.)

When a person is on the brink of psychosis, they often have an urgent need to seek out some contact with other human beings **because it gives them a bridge to reality** (side note: again, my experience confirms this. It seems like the body will naturally gravitate to what it actually needs, cool how that works out).

So really, this root issue that people are avoiding by playing the "well-liked" game is to protect against psychosis. Because when one's customary ways of orienting himself on the social hierarchy are threatened, and one is without other selves around, such a person is thrown back on **inner resources and inner strength**--it is these same resources and strength from within that modern man has neglected to develop.

All of this seems to validate the idea that loneliness is indeed a real, rather than imaginary, to such people lacking inner strength.

#### Escaping loneliness is nothing new

Pascal in the seventeenth century observed the great efforts of people to divert themselves, and he opined that the purpose fo the bulk of these diversions was to enable people to avoid thoughts of themselves.

But what made the 1950s special is that the fear of loneliness is much more extensive, and the defenses against it (seeking to be "well-liked", by whatever means of socializing) are more ridged and compulsive.

Another important aspect is the great emphasis society places on being **socially accepted**.

To be socially accepted is the "mark of prestige"--proof that we are "socially successful" by being forever *sought after* and by never being alone.

If one is well-liked (socially successful) one will rarely be physically alone; to not be liked is to have lost out in the race. The famous phrase of the time that reflects this motto is Willie Loman's "Death of a Salesman", where he uses the phrase, "Be well-liked and you will never be alone".

As we can see, social acceptance, or being "well-liked" is a defense against the underlying threat of psychosis resulting from a weak inner strength.

### Anxiety and the Threat to the self

It is erroneous to think that wars and economic depressions cause anxiety; rather our anxiety is often the cause of these events--they are symptoms of the same underlying cause.

May brings up the example of Fascism and Nazi totalitarianism. When a nation is prey to insupportable economic want and is psychologically and spiritually empty, it takes one charismatic and passionate individual with a definite plan to fill in the vacuum; the people end up selling their freedom in exchange for their anxiety. 

The same can happen in the US during heated politics; when a group suffers continuous anxiety, with no agreed-on constructive steps to take, its members sooner or later turn against each other. May uses the example fo McCarthyism to illustrate the heightened anxiety that led to a nation turning against itself.

### What is Anxiety?

Anxiety is helplessness/powerlessness in the face of an unidentified adversity; not knowing the threat, and therefore not knowing what plan of action to take.

(Side note: This is why **a problem written down is HALF-SOLVED!!!**)

What's more, anxiety is a threat to our existence as a whole being, rather than the existence of a subset of ourselves (e.g. a broken arm may hurt, but it does not threaten a person's existence).

The great bulk of our anxiety comes when some value we hold essential to our existence as selves is threatened.

Tying back to the idea of being "well-liked"--it's the same idea of challenging someone's position in the social hierarchy. There is great anxiety when people believe they're position in society is challenged, because of that lingering threat of psychosis from a weak inner strength--thereby creating this constant sense of anxiety.

(Side note: how does this idea compare with the teaching of Budda on "letting go" of past identifies?)

Anxiety has the same effect as psychosis; it disorients man, wiping out, temporarily, hsi knowledge of what and who he is, and blurring his view of reality around him.

#### The antidote to anxiety

Just as anxiety destroys our self-awareness, so awareness of ourselves can destroy anxiety. In other words, the stronger our consciousness of ourselves, the more we can take a strand against and overcome anxiety.

Anxiety, like a fever, is a sign that an inner struggle is in progress; it is evidence that a psychological or spiritual batter is going on. So long as this conflict is present, there is an open possibility that we can becomes aware of the causes of the conflict, and find a solution on a higher level of health.

Anxiety is simply nature's way of indicating to us that we need to solve a problem.

The more the threat wins, the more then our awareness of ourselves is surrounded; the greater our self-strength (our capacity to persevere our awareness of ourselves and the objective world around us) the less we will be overcome by the threat.

Our task, then, is to strength our consciousness of ourselves, to find centers of strength within ourselves which enable us to stand despite the confusion and bewilderment around us.

## Chapter 1 Reading Comprehension questions from ChatGPT

### Questions
1. What is the main theme or subject matter of the first chapter?
2. According to Rollo May, what is the primary cause of the current crisis of identity?
3. How does May define "identity" in the context of his book?
4. What are some examples of "pseudosolutions" that people often turn to in an attempt to find their identity
5. According to May, what role does society play in shaping our identity?
6. Describe May's concept of "inner identity" and its significance.
7. What does May mean by the phrase "the role of the innocent bystander"?
8. How does May suggest that individuals can begin to find their true identity?

### Answers
1. The main theme of the first chapter is an introduction towards the concepts of emptiness and looniness, and the call for action on our part as readers to begin looking inwards towards what we truly desire and wish to experience in life
2. The primary cause of the curries crisis of identity is emptiness. Specifically, people have lost touch with what they feel and truly want. As a result, people act as "mirror reflections" or each other in the hopes of being "well-liked" by everyone. But deep down, man is simply "going through the mechanical motions" of life.
3. Identity, according to May, involves a deep exploration of one's inner being (our desires, values, and authentic interests) rather than passively conforming to external expectations. Finding the "identity" is a process of self-discovery and self-understanding through both introspection and retrospection, as opposed to merely accepting societal norms or trying to fit into predetermined roles.
4. "pseudosolutions" of finding identity includes May's concept of the "gyroscope man". These are people who have a false "inner strength" that is really based on compartmentalization and repression of one's true desires while blindly following the rules, values, and traditions passed on from previous generations without questioning them or considering their own authentic needs. These people end up rigid and inflexible, unable to adapt, change, and grow as the climate of time inevitably changes.
5. Society, specifically our relationship to people, orient us in life. Man gets his original experience of being a self our of his relatedness to other people. It is through these social relationships and the role we play in society that man gets his original experience of being a self out of his relatedness to other people. In the absence of people, and the onset of looniness, man's self is at threat, and the risk of psychosis from losing our awareness of ourselves becomes a major issue.
6. "Inner identity" is simply self-awareness; this includes aspects of our genuine interests, values, and ambitions. 
7. Note: I don't know if the concept of "innocent bystander" was mentioned in the book, but I liked GPT's response enough to include it here as reference.

"
In summary, the role of the innocent bystander refers to passive conformity and reliance on external influences to determine one's identity, which May argues hinders personal growth and self-discovery.

In May's book, "Man's Search for Himself," he introduces the concept of "the role of the innocent bystander." This concept refers to individuals who passively observe and conform to societal expectations without critically engaging with their own desires and values. They become mere spectators in their own lives, allowing others to dictate their identity and choices.

May argues that the role of the innocent bystander is problematic because it stifles individual autonomy and self-discovery. By relinquishing their active agency, individuals fail to develop a genuine sense of self and rely on external influences to define their identity. They become disconnected from their own aspirations, leading to a sense of emptiness and the loss of personal fulfillment.

May encourages individuals to resist the role of the innocent bystander and instead **actively** participate in shaping their own identity. This involves 
- questioning societal norms
- reflecting on personal values
- engaging in introspection to discover one's true self

By taking an active role in their own lives, individuals can break free from the constraints of the bystander role and find a more authentic and fulfilling path.
"
8. Periods of solitude for introspection and retrospection are merely *starting points* towards man's search for himself (his true identity). The next steps include embracing one's one unique desires and aspirations by **actively** seeking out experiences that align with their inner selves.

## Chapter 2: The Roots of Our Malady

### Summary

#### One Sentence Summary

The chapter explores the reasons behind the current age of anxiety and emptiness, attributing it to the loss of personal freedom and identity in favor of conforming to societal norms, a shift in values, diminished means of self-expression, and a disconnection from nature, suggesting that the solution lies in reevaluating and rediscovering individual uniqueness and values to cultivate inner strength to benefit society.

#### One Paragraph Summary

The purpose of this chapter is to ask the question: what basic changes are occurring to make this an age of anxiety and emptiness? How can history help explain this issue?

When we speak of loss of the sense of self, we are speaking of people who have scarified their personal freedom and identity for the **conformity** of the herd. 

And why would these people make such a decision? Why would we willingly sacrifice our genuine interests, dreams, ambitions, and desires for a herd mentality that leaves us feeling empty? Here are four main reasons:

1. **The loss in the belief in the worth** of a person as a result of feeling **powerless** in creating their own life and unaware of what they want and feel leads these same people to sacrifice their self identity for perceived herd direction and mentality.
2. People, understandingly so, become frustrated by the seemingly sudden change in "how to play the game" of life because **the center of values for society have shifted**. Naturally, this leads to this emptiness and question of values--what should we aim for, in this void of values that no longer serve us? 
3. **A diminished quality in the means of communicating our selves** that enhance our experience of spiritual isolation and loneliness, in our inability to both feel the significance of our language as well as express it for others to understand.
4. **Our loss in the ability to relate to nature** is a reflection of modern man’s loss in his own self.

The solution is to reevaluation and rediscover. Rediscovering the unique powers and initiative of each individual. Revaluation and transevaluation of all values as an act of ultimate self-examination for mankind by thinking deeply to ask ourselves what we individually truly value. Molding a wholistic personality that unifies the qualities that make us us. It is this quality, May argues, that will result in the greatest good to society over the long run--that is, a single person with a well developed inner strength.

### The loss of the center of values in our society

The purpose of this chapter is to ask the question: what basic changes are occurring to make this an age of anxiety and emptiness? To begin discussion, we analyze the historical trends of the past.

Similar to the ideas presented in the book, "The Fourth Turning" by William Strauss and Neil Howe, the 1950s represent a period of changing social values and goals.

May outlines two values that are in a state of transition:
- Individual competition
- Reason

Both of these values have guided much of the development of the western world since the age of the Renaissance.

#### Unlearning Individual Competition

Individual competition is the classic laissez-faire theory in economics that advocates for men to further their own economic self-interest, which in turn results in a macro effect that maximized the economic interest of the entire community.

However, the industrial revolution of the 18th century led to the growth and development of big businesses and monopolies in the later centuries--leading people to question how they can become *individual* competitors in the face of giant conglomerates. This transformed the individual worker from a solitary worker to a professional belonging to a bigger entity such as a big corporation or university system.

In the process, people have had to unlearn the idea of individual competition in exchange for the learning of collective cooperation. 

It's **vital** to note that May is **NOT** suggesting we dismiss individual effort and initiative--rather the unique powers and initiative of each individual must be *rediscovered*. But more on that later.

The mindset of individual competition becomes troublesome during this transition period when a social welfare was not yet developed. This old idea mixed with competition from big companies led to the mindset that a loss on one person is a gain on another person's scramble towards the top of the ladder. Consequently, the psychological problems that resulted from this undeveloped idea included increased anxiety and isolation for each other--since each person was seen as a potential rival or enemy. 

May brings up the work of Arthur Miller's *Death of a Salesman*; where the protagonist of the story attempts to conceal his competitive attitude with a facade of being "well-liked". The protagonist, realizing that what he has been taught no longer works with the changing policies of his company, begins to fail miserably (again, this is the rigidity and inflexibility of the "gyroscope man") until finally he decides to take matters into his own hands by committing suicide. The ending remark from his son was, **"he never knew who he was"**.

Note: Always remember that suicide is a permanent solution to temporary situation--it's always best to weather the storm and persist during these downfalls, as it will teach you more about yourself than any other period in your life.

#### Unlearning Reason

Throughout the early centuries, reason worked well to advance the state of science and education. To many people, the idea of reason also implied "universal reason"; it was man's challenge to discover these universal principles from which man could live a happy life.

It was during the 19th century were we witness a gradual split up of reason from "emotion" and "will". 

Prior to Descartes' work, man help the following perspectives:
- Reason would give the answer to any problem
- will power was putting the answers from reason into effect
- emotions generally got in the way of things, so they were repressed

These attitudes led to the transition of reason into *intellectualistic rationalization*, where we find conflicts between instinct, ego, and superego (and later comes Freud to the rescue!).

When Spinoza in the 17th century used the word reason, he meant an *attitude* toward life in which the mind united the emotions with the ethical goals and other aspects of the whole man--this in in contrast to the splitting of the personality the comes form intellectualistic rationalization.

Intellectualistic rationalization would ask the question, "should I follow reason **or** give away to sensual passions and needs, **or** be faithful to my ethical duty", whereas someone sharing Spinoza's perspective would ask, 

> "How does the unity of my mind with the whole of existence impact my perception of self, my understanding of truth, and my ethical considerations?"

It's not without standing that the emphasis of one person getting ahead of the other greatly blocks the possibilities of loving one's neighbor. 

#### The splitting up of the personality

Questions such as "Why does economic striving need to be *against* one's fellow men?", or "Why does reason need to be *against* emotion?" each bring up good points.

It's important to realize that the characteristic of a period of change is precisely that everyone does ask the wrong questions.

Why? Because the old goals, criteria, and principles are still *habitually* set in our minds--it is this resistance to establish a new habit of thinking that leads people to ask questions which never could lead to the right answer. 

It is this inability to completely change oneself that leads people to inadequate solutions in search of the truth:
- "reason" operates while goes to class
- "emotion" operates when one visits a lover
- "will power" operates when studying for an exam

Yet it is this compartmentalization of values and goals that quickly leads to undermining the unity of the personality (the self) into "pieces" within as well as without--leading many without direction as to which way to go (hence the anxiety).

Freud was among the few men who recognized this splitting of the personality and encouraged men to seek unity for our lives.

The typical archetype of the person with split personalities is as follows:
- A husband who goes off to business
- He keeps his work and his family in different compartments
- He treats his wife like a doll
- Note: this is a reference to Ibsen's *A Doll House* play

Personal Question: I wonder how this relates to Alan Watts' claim "view everything you do as play, and do not make a distinction between work and play" as well as Jeff Bezos' ideal of a "work-life integration" rather than "work-life balance".

What many people don't understand is that people like Freud, Ibsen, and Cézanne were not profits of a new generation, rather the last great men of a previous generation who coasted on the goals of their time. These men lived and experienced a time before the emptiness.

#### Solutions from Friedrich Nietzsche's Prophecy

Soren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Franz Kafka are among the people who foresaw the destruction of values and the emptiness that would follow in the 20th century. Each of these men saw that we cannot ride on the goals of the past.

Technology advances so quickly, that Nietzsche was the first to point out that man's great advancements without a parallel advance in ethics and self-understanding would lead to Nihilism.

What Nietzsche is emphasizing is the loss of values from society; in the absence of newfound values to deal with the changing times, society falls into the same tyranny and waves of massacres that we witness from WWII.

So what's the solution? A **revaluation** and **transevaluation** of *all* values as an act of ultimate self-examination for mankind.

Stated simply: we ought to think deeply and reevaluate what we value, and that starts at the individual level.

Values and goals which provided a unifying center for previous centuries in the modern period no longer are cogent. We have not yet found the *new center* which will enable us to *choose our goals* contructively, and thus to overcome the painful bewilderment and anxiety of not knowing which way to move.

Having a framework of values and principles enables us to choose the right goals and ambitions to pursue.

### The Loss of the sense of self

The loss of the self is a result of the over-reliance on the herd.

In the face of totalitarian movements and uncontrolled economic depressions, we tend to feel smaller as persons. This leads to people forming the habitual mental story that they are insignificant and powerless, and rightly so, because pragmatically, how can anyone go up against the economic and political movements of the mid 20th century? 

The authoritarianism of the 20th century was largely accepted **NOT** because many people explicitly believed in it, rather because they feel themselves *individually powerless*, anxious, and *empty*. 

It is precisely this loss of self, this loss in the belief in the worth of a person, that **causes** these mass social and political movements. The loss of self and the rise of collectivist movement are both the result of the *same underlying, historical* changes in our society.

So the effort is to be fought on both flanks: (1) opposing the dehumanizing of the self through the group (2) recover our experiences and belief in the worth and dignity of the person.


#### Archetypes who lack self-awareness

- Albert Camus' "The Stranger" novel, main character who
    - acts without any clear decision or awareness on his part
    - as though everything happened *to* him
    - Never acts like himself
    - A man missing both courage and despair
    - Lacks awareness of himself
    - A "stranger" to himself
- Those who tend to be performers in life rather than persons who live and act as themselves
- Court-jester attitude of power and value being correlated with passivity rather than action

#### The function of Laughter

One’s sense of humor is connected with one’s sense of selfhood. Humor normally should have the function of preserving the sense of self. It is an expression of our uniquely human capacity to experience ourselves as subjects who are not swallowed up in the objective situation.

It is the healthy way of feeling a “distance” between one’s self and the problem, a way of standing off and looking at one’s problem with perspective. One cannot laugh when in an anxiety panic, for then one is swallowed up, one has lost the distinction between himself as the subject and the objective world around him.

So long as one can laugh, furthermore, he is not completely under the domination of anxiety or fear–hence the accepted belief in folklore that to be able to laugh in times of danger is a sign of courage.

The humor occurs because of a new appreciation of one’s self as a subject acting in an objective world.

Humor can deepen a reader’s feeling of worth and dignity as a person, and remove blinds from his eyes as he confronts the issues facing him.

In cases of borderline psychotics, so long as the person has genuine humor–so long, that is, as he can laugh, or look at himself with the thought, as one person puts it. “What a crazy person I’ve been!”–he is preserving his identity as self.

There are a few categories of laughter and humor to consider.

Generally, having a good self of humor of one's self is positive.

There are two types of negative laughters:
1. Quantitative laugher
    - Laughter is then an escape from anxiety and emptiness in ostrich-fashion rather than a way of gaining new and more courageous perspective in facing one's perplexities.
    - The simple laughing mechanism has the same function as the release of tension from alcohol and sex.
    - But like sex and drinking when engaged in for escapist reasons, this kind of laughter leaves one as lonely and unrelated to himself afterwards as before.
2. Vindictive laughter
    - laugher of triumph that bears no relation to smiling
    - laughter in anger or rage
    - Goes along with seeing one's self as triumphant over *other* selves, rather than being an indication of a new step in the achievement of one's own selfhood

Both quantitative and vindictive laughter reflect the humor of people who have to a great extent **lost the sense of the dignity and significance of persons**.

### The loss of Language for Personal Communication

In this section, May is claiming that our ability to communicate our self identity with the world is diminishing in quality. 

May mentions how the loss in this effectiveness of language is a *symptom* of a disrupted historical period; during peak periods of society, language is transformation, creative, and inspiring (Shakespeare, King James, Socrates, the Founding Fathers, etc. ), while at other points language is weak, vague, and uncompelling. 

Likewise, when a culture is in its historical phase of growing toward unity, its language reflects the unity and and power; whereas when a culture is in the process of a fourth turning, dispersal, and disintegration, the language losses its power.

While spoken and written language is a reflection of our changing times, the same can be said about art, music, or any medium through which one attempts to self-express.

Artist generally seek to speak in their paintings from some solid reality in the self experiencing the world. Modern art can be viewed as an honest portrayal of the condition of our time.

But the artists, and the rest of us too, remain spiritually isolated and at sea, and so we cover up our loneliness by chattering with other people about the things we *do* have language for--current affairs, politics, climate disasters, tv shows, the latest sports events. Our deeper emotional experiences are pushed further away, and we tend, thus, to become emptier and lonelier.

Imagine what this implies about our society in a world where deeper sentiments can only be communicated through limited language?

### "Little we see in nature that is ours"

You know it's quite funny; it seems like many of the great thinkers and contributors of society emphasize a call back to nature. Ray Dalio, Laozi--just to name two people. 

Not to mention how one of the chief characteristics of the Renaissance in Europe was an upsurging of enthusiasm for nature in all its forms (like the work of Giotto). It is this strong feeling for nature that is the hallmark strength for the great Renaissance man.

Even here, May speaks much on the relationship between ourselves and nature.

People who have lost the sense of their identity as selves also tend to lose their sense of relatedness to nature--much the same way a person may not feel inspiring by the seemingly little things like a sunset, the ocean breeze, or the chipper of birds in the morning. 

May claims that our relation to nature tends to be destroyed not only by our emptiness, but also by our anxiety--anxiety compels us to withdraw from nature into the isolated realms (like withdrawing from the open field into the perceived safety of a cave).

So, when a person experiences emptiness from within, that becomes the perception or lense through which he experiences the world around him--emptied, dried-up, and dead. 

To relate to nature is to understand its vastness for creative and destructive potential with pure impersonality--the strong seas can flip any boat, the hungry grizzly bear will annihilate any threat to her cubs.

It's also internalizing that the cliff off the mountain peak would break a man--and his extinction as a person would not play a single difference towards the walls of the granite mountain side.

It becomes this profound threat of "nothingness" or "nonbeing" which one experiences when he fully confronts his relation with inorganic being.

The loss in the ability to relate to nature is a reflection of modern man's loss in his own self.

### The Loss of the sense of tragedy

The task that lays before us is quite simple: we must rediscover the sources of strength and integrity within ourselves.

Here is May's big claim for this chapter:

> We  could go farther and point out that **finding the center of strength within ourselves is in the long run the *best contribution* we can make to our fellow men**. This is what our society needs--not new ideas and inventions, important as these are, and not geniuses and supermen, but persons who can *be*, that is, persons who have a center of strength within themselves. 

> A **single person** with indigenous inner strength exercises a great calming effect on panic among people around him.

# Part 2: Rediscovering Selfhood

## Chapter 3: The Experience of Becoming a Person

### Consciousness of Self--The Unique Mark of Man

By around age two, the human baby becomes conscious of himself; this is the birth and beginning of his own entity.

Consciousness is a powerful responsibility and superpower that comes with a price: neuroticism, anxiety, guilt, doubt, and any negative perspective.

When a boy is born, he may feel terribly powerless in the comparison with greater and strong adults around him.

Dogs for example lack consciousness, which permits them to enjoy the present moment bliss, but at the cost of not being able to distinguish between the self and the "I", nor with the ability to learn from the past and plan for the future.

These are the feats that make man the architect of his reality--he can use his consciousness to create the reality he desires. Man can use his consciousness to influence his own development as a person.

This is what it means to be created in the image of God; to fulfill man's potentialities and using his consciousness to create.

#### The struggle towards selfhood

Most of the data for these conflicts of childhood come from adults who are struggling, in dreams, memories, or in present-day relations, **to overcome what in their past lives** originally blocked them in becoming fully born as persons.

> Almost every adult is, in greater or lesser degree, still **struggling** on the long journey **to achieve selfhood** on the basis on the basis of the patterns which were set in his early experiences in the family.

The self is always born and grows in interpersonal relationships. Conformity is the great destroyer of selfhood. 

What needs to be emphasized is not only the admitted fact that we are to some extent created by each other but also our capacity to experience, and create, ourselves--our relations to others is just as important as our relation and knowledge of ourself.

Our every thought in the process of arguing against the consciousness of self proves this very consciousness in ourselves.

#### Making Sense of Descartes

The consciousness of one's identity as a self certainly is not an intellectual idea. When Descartes claimed, "I think, therefore I am", he meant, "I exist because I am a thinking creature".

What does this mean?

You and I never think of ourselves as an idea. We rather picture ourselves as doing something, and then we experience, in imagination, the **feelings** that we will have when we are in actuality doing that thing--we experience ourselves as a **thinking-intuitive-feeling and acting unity**.

The self is thus not merely the sum of the various "roles" one plays--it is the capacity by which one *knows* he plays these roles; the center from which one sees and is aware of these so-called different "sides" of himself.

#### The Importance of Developing the Self Identity

The experience of one's own identity is the simplest experience in life even though, at the same time, it is the most profound.

Every organism has one and only one central need in life, to fulfill its own potentialities.

What makes man's potentiality more difficult than that of the acorn becoming an oak, or the puppy becoming the dog, is that man must do so in self-consciousness--that is to say that his development is not automatic the same way an oak becomes a tree, but rather must be to some extent chosen and affirmed by himself.

Man does not grow automatically like a tree, but fulfills his potentialities only as he in his own consciousness plans and chooses.

If any organism fails to fulfill its potentialities, it becomes sick. 

The flowing of your blood, your heart action, your whole organism would be weaker. And in the same way if man does not fulfill his potentialities as a person, he becomes to that extent constricted and ill. 

This illness is the basis for neurosis--the person's unused potentialities, blocked by hostile conditions in the environment (past or present) and by his own internalized conflicts, turn inward and cause morbidity.

Or, in the words of William Blake, 

> "Energy is Eternal Delight. He who desires but acts not breeds pestilence."

#### What can we expect when we do develop our selfhood?

To the extent that we do fulfill our potentialities as persons, we experience the profoundest **joy** to which human being is heir.

It's the quiet joy when he can love, create, and plan. This joy is the affect which comes when we use our powers. 

> **Joy**, rather than happiness, **is the goal of life**, for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings.

It's the joy that comes as a result of **realizing one's identity as being worthy of dignity**, affirm his being, if need be, against all other beings and the whole inorganic world.

It's the same power shown in the life of Socrates, who was so confident in himself and his values that he could take his being condemned to death not as a defeat but as a greater fulfillment than compromising his beliefs.

And here's the good news: this joy is is not limited to the heroic or outstanding figures, but abundant for all who choose to act, no matter how inconspicuous, which is done as an honest and responsible expression of his own powers.
