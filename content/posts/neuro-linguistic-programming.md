## Chapter 1: Getting to know NLP

### Summary

NLP is all about having the right attitude towards life that will enable you to create the right adaptable mental model from which you move through life not by responding to the world around you, but by responding to your *model or map of the world*.

### Notes

NLP is the study of the structure of subjective experience and art and science of communication.

NLP enables you to understand what makes you tick, how you think, how you feel, and how you make sense of the world around you.

Here are a few more definitions of NLP:
- The key to learning
- The manuel for your brain
- The secret of successful people
- The method of creating your own future

These are the four pillars of NLP:
1. Rapport
2. Sensory Awareness
3. Outcome Thinking
4. Behavioral Flexibility

NLP offers a model from which you can learn from someone who's really good at what they do; you discover how to model anyone you admire.

According to NLP, you move through life not by responding to the world around you, but by responding to your *model or map of the world*.

Side Note: How do we know if this model accurately represents reality? Is that where CBT comes in?

A fundamental assumption of NLP is that the "map is not territory" and that each individual has different maps of how the world operates. In other words, two people may experience the same event, but with different interpretations.

NLP **does not** change the world, rather it helps you change the way you observe your world.

Side note: "Seek not to change the world, for it is a fleeting thing, ever changing, and beyond thy grasp. Seek instead to change thy self, and thou shalt find true power and inner peace."

The NLP approach is that you learn best by finding someone else who already excels at whatever you want to learn. Then, by modeling them, you can update your map.

> If your attitudes don't support you in living richly rewarding life, you may want to consider changing them.

Many people spend a lot of time looking at the negatives in their lives (what they hate or complain about), but by conditioning yourself to concentrate on what you do want, **positive results** can be achieved quickly.

NLP thrives with two key attributes:
1. curiosity/humility
    - accepting you don't know all the answers 
2. Willingness to be confused
    - Life is absurd

Above all else, have fun! Take your work seriously, but hold good humor on yourself


## Chapter 2: Some Basic Assumptions of NLP

### Summary

NLP operates on the assumption that people interpret the world through their mental maps of meaning; we become what we think about.

### Notes

One of the NLP assumptions is "the map is not territory", meaning that the internal map we create of the external world that's shaped by our unique experiences is never an exact replica of the map made by someone else perceiving the same surroundings as you.

In other words, what's outside can never be the same as what's inside your brain.

The map acts as a filter through which we observe the natural world around us.

The result of this personal filter is that everyone has a very individual map of the world (see point #7 on the [certainties of life](https://practicalityandsimplicity.com/posts/the-certainties-of-life/).)

This means:

> To communicate better, understand the mental map of the person(s) you're speaking to

We respond to life in accordance with the map we develop; this map is based on our beliefs, attitudes, memories, and cultural upbringing.

The right mental map can make accepting failure (and hence growth) more tolerable

> No matter how honorable or well-intentioned your communication is, the success of the interaction depends on how the listener receives the message, and not what you intend

This means the onus of effectively communicating is on you. If the person misunderstands, it's your fault, and this is good, because YOU have the flexibility to do things differently through your behavior and words.
