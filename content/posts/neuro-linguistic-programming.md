# Part 1: Introducing NLP

## Chapter 1: Getting to know NLP

### Summary

NLP is all about having the right attitude towards life that will enable you to create the right adaptable mental model from which you move through life not by responding to the world around you, but by responding to your *model or map of the world*.

### Notes

NLP is the study of the structure of subjective experience and art and science of communication.

NLP enables you to understand what makes you tick, how you think, how you feel, and how you make sense of the world around you.

Here are a few more definitions of NLP:
- The key to learning
- The manuel for your brain
- The secret of successful people
- The method of creating your own future

These are the four pillars of NLP:
1. Rapport
2. Sensory Awareness
3. Outcome Thinking
4. Behavioral Flexibility

NLP offers a model from which you can learn from someone who's really good at what they do; you discover how to model anyone you admire.

According to NLP, you move through life not by responding to the world around you, but by responding to your *model or map of the world*.

Side Note: How do we know if this model accurately represents reality? Is that where CBT comes in?

A fundamental assumption of NLP is that the "map is not territory" and that each individual has different maps of how the world operates. In other words, two people may experience the same event, but with different interpretations.

NLP **does not** change the world, rather it helps you change the way you observe your world.

Side note: "Seek not to change the world, for it is a fleeting thing, ever changing, and beyond thy grasp. Seek instead to change thy self, and thou shalt find true power and inner peace."

The NLP approach is that you learn best by finding someone else who already excels at whatever you want to learn. Then, by modeling them, you can update your map.

> If your attitudes don't support you in living richly rewarding life, you may want to consider changing them.

Many people spend a lot of time looking at the negatives in their lives (what they hate or complain about), but by conditioning yourself to concentrate on what you do want, **positive results** can be achieved quickly.

NLP thrives with two key attributes:
1. curiosity/humility
    - accepting you don't know all the answers 
2. Willingness to be confused
    - Life is absurd

Above all else, have fun! Take your work seriously, but hold good humor on yourself


## Chapter 2: Some Basic Assumptions of NLP

### Summary

NLP operates on the assumption that people interpret the world through their mental maps of meaning; we become what we think about.

### Notes

One of the NLP assumptions is "the map is not territory", meaning that the internal map we create of the external world that's shaped by our unique experiences is never an exact replica of the map made by someone else perceiving the same surroundings as you.

In other words, what's outside can never be the same as what's inside your brain.

The map acts as a filter through which we observe the natural world around us.

The result of this personal filter is that everyone has a very individual map of the world (see point #7 on the [certainties of life](https://practicalityandsimplicity.com/posts/the-certainties-of-life/).)

This means:

> To communicate better, understand the mental map of the person(s) you're speaking to

We respond to life in accordance with the map we develop; this map is based on our beliefs, attitudes, memories, and cultural upbringing.

The right mental map can make accepting failure (and hence growth) more tolerable

> No matter how honorable or well-intentioned your communication is, the success of the interaction depends on how the listener receives the message, and not what you intend

This means the onus of effectively communicating is on you. If the person misunderstands, it's your fault, and this is good, because YOU have the flexibility to do things differently through your behavior and words.


## Chapter 3: Discovering Whoâ€™s Directing Your Life

### Summary
You can change beliefs with repetitive affirmations, because repetition is the mother of mastery.
### Notes

This chapter focuses on the power of the unconscious mind.

The key to bringing your unconscious mind into alignment with your conscious desires and goals is understanding the strengths of each part and how they work.

What prevents us from fulfilling our potential are the closely held beliefs that we hold deep in our psyche.

Similar to how the law of attraction works, your unconscious can't process negatives; it interprets **everything** you think as a positive thought. **This is why stating your goals in the positive is important**.

In order to direct the unconscious mind, you get to open up communication channels between your conscious and unconscious minds. This rapport is developed through quiet meditation and examining the memories presented to you by your unconscious mind.

Part of the function of the unconscious mind is to repress memories with unresolved negative emotions.

Another function of the unconscious mind is to present repressed memories for examination in order to **release trapped emotions**.

Unfortunately, the unconscious mind doesn't always pick the most appropriate time to present a memory to be examined--otherwise known as "leaking out" in unintended ways.

There's a section of this book that focuses on phobias.

Your values and beliefs are unconscious filters that you use to decided what bits of data coming through your senses you pay attention to and what bits of data you ignore.

This means that the unconscious 9/10ths of your brain has been sitting there on the quiet, building up all sorts of beliefs and making all sorts of decisions about you and your environment, and you're not even aware of them.

> Be aware of the limiting beliefs that lurk within your unconscious mind.

The good news is that beliefs can and do change (change is the only constant).

You can change beliefs with repetitive affirmations, because repetition is the mother of mastery.


## Chapter 4:  Taking Charge of Your Life

Rather than playing the blaming game, ask yourself, "what's the lesson that I need to learn so that this problem is no longer an issue?"; this is called the "outcome" frame, and it's the most constructive framework within NLP from which we may find the right solution.

NLP builds on SMART goals by making you use all your senses to design a goal, and to fine tune it to be more than just the markers of smart. 

So, in addition to the SMART criteria:
1. Specific
2. Measurable
3. Attainable
4. Realistic
5. Time-bound

NLP includes additional questions to answer:
1. Is the goal stated in the positive?
2. Is the goal self-initiated, maintained, and under my voluntary control?
    - You cannot wish for someone else to change, nor can you change for someone else
    - To what extend does the outcome rely on just YOU?
3. Does the goal describe the evidence procedure?
    - When do you know you've achieved the goal?
    - How do you know you're getting the desired outcome?
    - What will you be doing when you get it?
    - What will you see, hear, taste, smell, and feel when you have it?
4. Is the context of the goal clearly defined (the "why?")?
5. Does the goal Identify the necessary resources?
6. Have I evaluated whether the goal is ecological?
    - In your own ecological context, does the goal fit your style and who you are?
    - What will you gain or lose if you win?
    - What will happen if you get it?
    - What will NOT happen if you get it?
    - What will happen if you DO NOT get it?
    - what will NOT happen if you DO NOT get it?
7. Does the goal identify the first step I need to take?
    - The journey of a thousand steps begins with one step
