## Chapter 1: How Perspective Takes Shape

### Summary 

#### One Sentence Summary

To make the right choices, we should seek to do what we know is right, in spite of how it makes us feel or how it makes us appear to others. The reward of making the more responsible choice leads to an accurate view of the world and the ability to handle greater truths.

#### One Paragraph summary

Our decisions can either increase our self-esteem and confidence, and build us up as great characters in this world, or it can degrade our self-esteem, and make our actions and character degrade over time.

To make the right choices, we should seek to do what we know is right, in spite of how it makes us feel or how it makes us appear to others. The reward of making the more responsible choice leads to an accurate view of the world and the ability to handle greater truths.

### Notes

In decision theory, three forces are at odds with one another:
1. **The Soul**: Seeks to do what is right
2. **The Ego**: Seeks to be viewed right
3. **The Body**: Wishes to escape from it all

These, lead to three types of decisions you can make:
1. Choosing what feels good
    - Excess leads to overindulgence
2. Choosing what makes you look good
    - Vanity can lead to downfall
3. Choosing what is actually good
    - This is where we gain self-esteem; when we make responsible choices and do what is right; soul-oriented (moral or conscious) choice.

#### Do Good to Feel Good

Each time we sacrifice what is responsible because we can't rise above the whims of an impulse, we lose self-respect; if we only act for the approval of others, we become empty inside (as Rollo May would point out).

To the extent that we don't love ourselves, our willingness to endure short-term pain for long-term gain wanes.

#### Perspective = Mental Health

Side Note: This is why I hate being in a small town or isolated office. Seeing the contrast of a bigger city simply gives me daily perspective on my problems.

As our behavior becomes increasingly reckless and irresponsible, the ego swells to compensate for feelings of guilt, insecurity, and shame; our perspective narrows, and we see more of the self and less of the world, which makes us even more sensitive and unstable. 

To the degree we refuse to accept the truth about ourselves and our lives, and overcome our laziness and fear of pain, the ego engages to "protect" us by shifting blame elsewhere. 

This leads to the core belief, "If there is nothing wrong with me, then there must be something wrong with you; or the world is unfair; or people are out to get me. 

This eventually leads to paranoia, pessimism, and ultimately unhappiness with oneself.

Emotional instability and anger is fundamentally a *lack of clarity*, the degree to which the ego infects us.

An ideal sequence of actions would be:
1. Responsible (soul-oriented) choice
2. self-esteem increases
3. ego shrinks
4. perspective widens
5. **undistorted reality**
6. see and accept truth (despite the pain in knowing)
7. positive emotional health
8. acting responsibly

Per contra, the opposite sequence leads to downward spirals
1. Irresponsible choice (ego and/or body)
2. self-esteem decreases
3. ego expands
4. perspective narrows
5. distorted reality
6. unable/unwilling to see and accept truth (leads to further unnecessary suffering)
7. negative mental health
8. acting irresponsibly


## Chapter 2: Angry with Ourselves, Angry at the world

### Summary

#### One Sentence Summary

Our ego edits the world to eliminate anything that will hurt or reveal us, either to ourselves or to others; we seek to defend our self-image at all costs, including truth.

#### One Paragraph Summary

When the ego takes control, we no longer live for ourselves, but for the image the ego has constructed; in exchange, we lose ourselves, our self-identity, inner strength, and our freedom. Since we lose our self-identity and capacity for freedom, we lose the ability to feel and project love; when we don't love ourselves, we can't give love, nor can we feel it. The love we do receive is tainted with the ego's persona. This is where emptiness and anger come in to fill the hollowness of man. A person driven by ego and lacking inner strength will turn outward by seeking to control others and gain their approval to look good, but these people who seek self-esteem from external sources can never truly be content; they are the very epitome of a bottomless pit.

### Notes

> In an unsuccessful effort to fulfill their needs, all patients have a common characteristic: **they deny the reality of the world around them**. Whether it's a partial denial or outright blotting of all reality, the result is still the same.

The ego colors the world so that we remain untarnished; but in attempting to make ourselves feel good, we contaminate that very thing that will **MAKE** us good.

> **Cognitive dissonance** is the feeling of uncomfortable tension and stress that comes from holding two contradictory ideas simultaneously.

It is the by-product of tension between the soul and the ego--**when we choose to either accept reality or reduce dissonance by a number of defense mechanisms**.

Common defense mechanisms in the face of cognitive dissonance include:
- avoidance
- denial
- justification
    - I personally wonder how often I may use this; how is this different than from collecting new data?
    - I think I should know when I am collecting data just to avoid a truth I don't wish to hear
    - At the end of the day, collect the evidence. CBT helps

> People twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until the pieces fall into the pattern they wish to see.

What makes it worse is that the brain will then replay these distorted views by activating circuits involved in pleasure, because feelings of cognitive dissonance can literally make your brain hurt!

#### The Mask that doesn't come off

Our ego edits the world to eliminate anything that will hurt or reveal us, either to ourselves or to others; we seek to defend our self-image at all costs, including truth.

Interestingly enough, when the ego takes control, we no longer live for ourselves, but for the image the ego has constructed; in exchange, we lose ourselves, our self-identity, inner strength, and our freedom.

Since we lose our self-identity and capacity for freedom, we lose the ability to feel and project love; when we don't love ourselves, we can't give love, nor can we feel it. The love we do receive is tainted with the ego's persona. This is where emptiness and anger come in to fill the hollowness of man.

I absolutely love the imagery that Lieberman uses:

> Imagine pouring water into a cup with no bottom. As the cup is being filled, we feel content, but the moment someone stops filling it (we no longer get one's undivided attention, respect, or adoration) the cup quickly empties and we are left thirsty. The cup will never be full, and we will never be satisfied, no matter how much we receive.

> "A lacking on the inside can never be satisfied with something from the outside" --King Soloman

People who seek self-esteem from external sources can never truly be content; they are the very epitome of a bottomless pit.

> When we can't nourish ourselves through good choices, and thus gain self-respect, we turn to the rest of the world to feed us.

Our ever-shifting self-image becomes a direct reflection of the world around us. 

When we lack self-esteem, we push away the very people we so desperately want in our lives because we can't fathom why anyone would love someone as unlovable as ourselves. Whatever affection or kindness we receive, we hardly embrace it, if we even acknowledge it. We end up rejecting others before they have a chance to reject us.

The less self-control we have, the more desperately we manipulate events and the people around us, because when we cannot control ourselves, we need to feel as if we are in control of someone, something, or anything to feel a sense of power.

## Chapter 3: Isolated from Ourselves, Disconnected from Others

### Summary

#### One Sentence Summary

Much of man's unhappiness comes from his underdeveloped inner strength and his inability to care for others.

#### One Paragraph Summary

**Of course it's hard**. Anyone can be nice, warm, and caring when he's in a good mood. However, a true indicator of emotional health is a person who can respond to the needs of others, with care and patience, **even while** in a low emotional state or under physical distress. It is tendency to protect our external image that ends up making us feeling disconnected from others and seeking to take from others rather than being in a position to give unlimitedly.

### Notes

Extremely similar to what Rollo May writes in his book, "Man's search for himself":

> People with low self-esteem have difficulty not only receiving love, but also giving it as well. We can only give what we have, and if we don't have self-respect and self-love, then what can we give?

#### Give and Take

> Love is limitless; love is not selfish

A parent loves each child unlimitedly; a person who "loves" materialistic things does not actually care for them, rather he cares for himself and the materials make him happy. He is not giving to his art; his art gives to him, and so he takes.

Likewise: anger is easily triggered when we focus on our own pain and how difficult life is for us.

> **Michel's razor**: everyone experiences pain, and most people believe their pain is greater than everyone else's

##### Lust versus Love

Lust is the opposite of love. Lust is taking from someone in order to feel complete ourselves.

Love is focused on giving. Willingly, eagerly, and with anticipation of nothing in return.

When a person suffers from low self-esteem, he takes what he needs in an attempt to make himself feel whole. This person cannot really love, he can only control and take.

> The more self-esteem we have, the more complete we are as individuals

Just like the water cup example, when we only take to fill a constant void, we are left empty, and are forced to continue taking in a futile request to be fulfilled, which only reinforces our dependency and exhausts us emotionally and physically.

A person with low self-esteem will have difficulty accepting and favors and expressing gratitude. If the low self-esteem is severe, the person may develop hostile feelings towards the very people who try to help, because this person interprets the giver's actions as bringing greater awareness to his insecurities and shortcomings.

> Though this paradigm, we learn how to tell whether someone has high or low self-esteem; it is reflected in how he treats himself and others.

A person who lacks self-esteem may indulge in things to satisfy only his own desires, and he will not treat others particularly well (a product of an arrogant mentality). Paradoxically, this same person may cater to others because he craves their approval and respect, but he does not take care of his own needs (a product of the doormat mentality).

Only someone with high self-esteem can give responsibly, love and respect, to both himself and others.

#### Empathy vs Sympathy

Sympathy means we feel pity for a person's situation, but we are declined to exert ourselves to alleviate his plight; he is consumed with his own pain and is motivated to reduce his own suffering, rather than help the person who is in pain. Without genuine humility, he will not (nor does he have the capacity to) burden himself unless he receives a larger payout of acceptance or approval. His taking is disguised as giving, his fear is disguised as love.

Empathy, by comparison, is the capacity to share another's emotions and feel his pain, rather than merely feel sorry for him. The empathetic person feels grateful for knowing about others' troubles because he genuinely wants to alleviate their suffering. Moral development, rather than moral thinking, is what moves a person to altruistic behavior.

The ease with which we rise above our own problems and shift attention to the welfare of another is a reliable marker of emotional health.

> **Of course it's hard**. Anyone can be nice, warm, and caring when he's in a good mood. However, a true indicator of emotional health is a person who can respond to the needs of others, with care and patience, **even while** in a low emotional state or under physical distress.

A person who is not self-centered feels humility and a connection to others. The wall of "I am me and he is he" is broken down, and where there is no ego, there is a connection and bond. Fundamentally, anger is a disconnection, to avoid or inflict pain.

#### Smoke and Mirrors

Confidence is how effective we feel within a specific area or situation.

Self-esteem is defined as how much we recognize our inherent worth and feel deserving of happiness and good fortune. Self-esteem is shaped by the quality of our choices rather than the assets at our disposal.

When a person suffers from very low self-esteem, it doesn't matter how accomplished he appears, he depends on everyone and everything to boost his faltering self-image. A person's inflated sense of self does not derive from self-esteem, but from self-loathing.

> No matter how much a person appears to be happy with himself, if he is egocentric, that person suffers with feelings of inferiority. This statement is not a conjecture, but a law of human nature; it is physiological math.
