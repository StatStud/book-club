## Summary

### One Sentence Summary

To make the right choices, we should seek to do what we know is right, in spite of how it makes us feel or how it makes us appear to others. The reward of making the more responsible choice leads to an accurate view of the world and the ability to handle greater truths.

### One Paragraph summary

Our decisions can either increase our self-esteem and confidence, and build us up as great characters in this world, or it can degrade our self-esteem, and make our actions and character degrade over time.

To make the right choices, we should seek to do what we know is right, in spite of how it makes us feel or how it makes us appear to others. The reward of making the more responsible choice leads to an accurate view of the world and the ability to handle greater truths.

## Chapter 1: How Perspective Takes Shape

In decision theory, three forces are at odds with one another:
1. **The Soul**: Seeks to do what is right
2. **The Ego**: Seeks to be viewed right
3. **The Body**: Wishes to escape from it all

These, lead to three types of decisions you can make:
1. Choosing what feels good
    - Excess leads to overindulgence
2. Choosing what makes you look good
    - Vanity can lead to downfall
3. Choosing what is actually good
    - This is where we gain self-esteem; when we make responsible choices and do what is right; soul-oriented (moral or conscious) choice.

### Do Good to Feel Good

Each time we sacrifice what is responsible because we can't rise above the whims of an impulse, we lose self-respect; if we only act for the approval of others, we become empty inside (as Rollo May would point out).

To the extent that we don't love ourselves, our willingness to endure short-term pain for long-term gain wanes.

### Perspective = Mental Health

Side Note: This is why I hate being in a small town or isolated office. Seeing the contrast of a bigger city simply gives me daily perspective on my problems.

As our behavior becomes increasingly reckless and irresponsible, the ego swells to compensate for feelings of guilt, insecurity, and shame; our perspective narrows, and we see more of the self and less of the world, which makes us even more sensitive and unstable. 

To the degree we refuse to accept the truth about ourselves and our lives, and overcome our laziness and fear of pain, the ego engages to "protect" us by shifting blame elsewhere. 

This leads to the core belief, "If there is nothing wrong with me, then there must be something wrong with you; or the world is unfair; or people are out to get me. 

This eventually leads to paranoia, pessimism, and ultimately unhappiness with oneself.

Emotional instability and anger is fundamentally a *lack of clarity*, the degree to which the ego infects us.

An ideal sequence of actions would be:
1. Responsible (soul-oriented) choice
2. self-esteem increases
3. ego shrinks
4. perspective widens
5. **undistorted reality**
6. see and accept truth (despite the pain in knowing)
7. positive emotional health
8. acting responsibly

Per contra, the opposite sequence leads to downward spirals
1. Irresponsible choice (ego and/or body)
2. self-esteem decreases
3. ego expands
4. perspective narrows
5. distorted reality
6. unable/unwilling to see and accept truth (leads to further unnecessary suffering)
7. negative mental health
8. acting irresponsibly
