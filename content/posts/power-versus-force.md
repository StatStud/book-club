# Foreword
In the late 1970s, Dr. John Diamond founded *behavioral kinesiology*, which revealed that indicator muscles would strengthen or weaken in the presence of positive or negative **emotional and intellectual stimuli**, the same way with physical stimuli. His findings are documented in his book "Your Body doesn't lie".

A smile, for example, will make you test strong, while the statement "I hate you" will test you weak. 

# Preface

> all pain and suffering arises solely from the ego and not from God.

> "[the students with advance spiritual disciplines] realized that they weren't at the mercy of the world, but rather were affected **only by what their minds believed**"

Perhaps the very process of progress toward enlightenment could be shown to increase man's ability to resist the mutability of existence.

> "I was more and more powerfully struck by the capacity to change things in the world by merely envisioning them"

It seemed that the great tragedy of human life has always been that the psyche is so easily deceived; discord and strife have been the inevitable consequence of mankind's inability to distinguish the false from the true. 

> "I sought to be ordinary because just being ordinary in and of itself is an expression of divinity; the truth of one's real self can be discovered through the pathway of everyday life. The common place and God aren't distinct"

To live with care and kindness is all that is necessary; the test reveals itself in due time.

Hawkin's mission is quite simple:

> "To bring the Presence that has moved my life perhaps at least a little closer to the grasp of my fellow beings as I can reach"

Hawkins describes this Presence as "silent and conveys a state of peace". With it, all hear disappears, and spiritual joy occurs on a quiet level of inexplicable ecstasy. 

Why is this the case? Because with the Presence comes the experience of time stopping; there's no apprehension, regret, pain, nor anticipation; the source of joy is unending and ever-present. With no beginning or ending, there can be no grief, loss, or desire--and nothing needs to be done, for everything is already perfect and complete.

> When time stops, all problems disappear, for they are merely artifacts of a point of perception

When the mind grows silent, the thought *I am* also disappears.

According to Hawkins, here's how we can reach this state of Presence:
1. Intense Desire
2. Discipline to act with constant and universal forgiveness and gentleness, **without exception**
    - One must be compassionate toward everything, including one's own self and thoughts
3. A willingness to hold desires in abeyance and surrender personal will at every moment 
    - As each thought, feeling, longing, or deed is surrendered to God, the mind becomes more silent
    - Eventually it becomes possible to turn over the energy behind thought itself, *before* it even became thought

> "At first this seemed very difficult, but as time went on, it became habitual, automatic, and effortless. ***The process is like a rocket leaving Earth**."

The last sentence from the above quote was my exact visualization when living alone.

The constant push and pull towards this awareness is filled with periods of feeling betrayed by a "fall from grace", and the person goes in and out of higher levels of awareness.

# Introduction

Man's dilemma has been that he misidentifies his own intellectual artifacts (products of arbitrary point of perception) as reality. 

The inadequacy of the answers we receive is a direct consequence of the limitations implicit in the viewpoints of the questioner. Information is useless unless we know what it means and the context behind it.

But not only do we need the right questions, but we also need the right tools. The faults of all thought systems have been:
1. Failure to differentiate between subjective and objective
2. Disregard of the limitation of context inherent in basic design and terminology
3. Ignorance of the nature of consciousness itself
4. Misunderstanding of the nature of causality
    - Society constantly expends its efforts to correct effects instead of causes
    - There are no causes within the observable world; the observable world is a world of effects
    - So, instead of identifying causes in the world, Hawkins suggests that the reader identify the the conditions that underlie ostensible causes; these conditions exist only within a man's consciousness itself

The basic law of the universe is economy; the universe doesn't waste a single quark; everything serves a purpose and fits into a balance--there are no extraneous events.

> The main obstacle to man's development is his lack of knowledge about the nature of consciousness itself.

The book's outline is designed to make the simple obvious; in a world where data is abundant, this is much hard to persuade people. This brings up two classes of people: believers and nonbelievers. 

To nonbelievers, everything is falsehood until proven true; to believers, everything said in good faith is probably true unless it's proven otherwise.

The pessimistic position of cynical skepticism stems from fear, while the more optimistic manner of accepting information arises from self-confidence.

This book is written in a style that makes sense to both believers and nonbelievers.

Most people read books progressively, from the first chapter to the last. But this linear style of absorbing knowledge is limiting, fixed, and outdated. 

This book undergoes the challenge of presenting this material in the paradox of comprehending nonlinear concepts in a linear, sentence-by-sentence, structure. The book accomplishes this by using man's innate pattern recognition mechanism by applying repetitions to the fundamental lessons until they become familiar.
