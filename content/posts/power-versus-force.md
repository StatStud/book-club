# Summary

## One Sentence Summary

## One paragraph Summary

## What is the foundational knowledge required for me to learn this?
- Reading Rollo May's "Man's search for himself" is a great prerequisite

# Reading Comprehension questions from ChatGPT

# What ACTIONS/HABITS will I partake after reading this book?

# What Questions do I have after reading this book?

# What Phrase(s) can I add/validate to my mantras?
- It isn't life's events, **but how one reacts to them and the attitude that one has about them**, that determines whether such events have a positive or negative effect on one's life.


# Foreword
In the late 1970s, Dr. John Diamond founded *behavioral kinesiology*, which revealed that indicator muscles would strengthen or weaken in the presence of positive or negative **emotional and intellectual stimuli**, the same way with physical stimuli. His findings are documented in his book "Your Body doesn't lie".

A smile, for example, will make you test strong, while the statement "I hate you" will test you weak. 

# Preface

> all pain and suffering arises solely from the ego and not from God.

> "[the students with advance spiritual disciplines] realized that they weren't at the mercy of the world, but rather were affected **only by what their minds believed**"

Perhaps the very process of progress toward enlightenment could be shown to increase man's ability to resist the mutability of existence.

> "I was more and more powerfully struck by the capacity to change things in the world by merely envisioning them"

It seemed that the great tragedy of human life has always been that the psyche is so easily deceived; discord and strife have been the inevitable consequence of mankind's inability to distinguish the false from the true. 

> "I sought to be ordinary because just being ordinary in and of itself is an expression of divinity; the truth of one's real self can be discovered through the pathway of everyday life. The common place and God aren't distinct"

To live with care and kindness is all that is necessary; the test reveals itself in due time.

Hawkin's mission is quite simple:

> "To bring the Presence that has moved my life perhaps at least a little closer to the grasp of my fellow beings as I can reach"

Hawkins describes this Presence as "silent and conveys a state of peace". With it, all hear disappears, and spiritual joy occurs on a quiet level of inexplicable ecstasy. 

Why is this the case? Because with the Presence comes the experience of time stopping; there's no apprehension, regret, pain, nor anticipation; the source of joy is unending and ever-present. With no beginning or ending, there can be no grief, loss, or desire--and nothing needs to be done, for everything is already perfect and complete.

> When time stops, all problems disappear, for they are merely artifacts of a point of perception

When the mind grows silent, the thought *I am* also disappears.

According to Hawkins, here's how we can reach this state of Presence:
1. Intense Desire
2. Discipline to act with constant and universal forgiveness and gentleness, **without exception**
    - One must be compassionate toward everything, including one's own self and thoughts
3. A willingness to hold desires in abeyance and surrender personal will at every moment 
    - As each thought, feeling, longing, or deed is surrendered to God, the mind becomes more silent
    - Eventually it becomes possible to turn over the energy behind thought itself, *before* it even became thought

> "At first this seemed very difficult, but as time went on, it became habitual, automatic, and effortless. ***The process is like a rocket leaving Earth**."

The last sentence from the above quote was my exact visualization when living alone.

The constant push and pull towards this awareness is filled with periods of feeling betrayed by a "fall from grace", and the person goes in and out of higher levels of awareness.

# Introduction

Man's dilemma has been that he misidentifies his own intellectual artifacts (products of arbitrary point of perception) as reality. 

The inadequacy of the answers we receive is a direct consequence of the limitations implicit in the viewpoints of the questioner. Information is useless unless we know what it means and the context behind it.

But not only do we need the right questions, but we also need the right tools. The faults of all thought systems have been:
1. Failure to differentiate between subjective and objective
2. Disregard of the limitation of context inherent in basic design and terminology
3. Ignorance of the nature of consciousness itself
4. Misunderstanding of the nature of causality
    - Society constantly expends its efforts to correct effects instead of causes
    - There are no causes within the observable world; the observable world is a world of effects
    - So, instead of identifying causes in the world, Hawkins suggests that the reader identify the the conditions that underlie ostensible causes; these conditions exist only within a man's consciousness itself

The basic law of the universe is economy; the universe doesn't waste a single quark; everything serves a purpose and fits into a balance--there are no extraneous events.

> The main obstacle to man's development is his lack of knowledge about the nature of consciousness itself.

The book's outline is designed to make the simple obvious; in a world where data is abundant, this is much hard to persuade people. This brings up two classes of people: believers and nonbelievers. 

To nonbelievers, everything is falsehood until proven true; to believers, everything said in good faith is probably true unless it's proven otherwise.

The pessimistic position of cynical skepticism stems from fear, while the more optimistic manner of accepting information arises from self-confidence.

This book is written in a style that makes sense to both believers and nonbelievers.

Most people read books progressively, from the first chapter to the last. But this linear style of absorbing knowledge is limiting, fixed, and outdated. 

This book undergoes the challenge of presenting this material in the paradox of comprehending nonlinear concepts in a linear, sentence-by-sentence, structure. The book accomplishes this by using man's innate pattern recognition mechanism by applying repetitions to the fundamental lessons until they become familiar.


# Part 1: Tools

## Chapter 1: Critical Advances in Knowledge


### Summary

#### One Sentence Summary

Advances in STEM fields have led to new insights into human consciousness.


#### One Paragraph Summary

Nonlinear dynamics works the **opposite way**: from the unknown (the nondeterministic data of the question) to the known (the answer). **It operates within a different paradigm of causality**. The problem is then seen as one of definition and access, rather than a logical sequence. 

### Notes

What makes kinesiology special is that it exposes the intimate connection between the mind and the body.

All paths of inquiry (philosophy, theology, etc) converge to a common point: the quest for an organized understanding of the nature of pure consciousness.

Subjective and objective are the same; the insights from the fields of study such as nonlinear dynamics, quantum physics, or AI transcend the limited viewpoint that creates the illusion of duality.

If the subjective and objective are indeed the same, then we can find the answers to all questions by merely looking **within** man himself.

By simply recording observations, we can see a grand picture emerge, one that sees no limitations with respect to further investigation.

The human mind is the most advance computer known to man, and it's freely available to man at any time and any place. The body can discern the difference between that which is supportive of life and that which is not, for all living things react positively to what is life-supporting and negatively to what is not--this is the fundamental mechanism of survival.

Inherent in **all** forms of life is the capacity to detect change and react correctively. 
- trees become smaller at high altitudes where oxygen is scarce
- long distance runners are light while sprinters are muscular

Attractor research is the field of study that concerns itself with the mapping of fields of human consciousness; it's concerned with the identification of power ranges of energy fields utilizing critical point analysis (for example, it's possible to paralyze a large windmill just by knowing where the stop switch is).

It's worth mentioning in this talk of nonlinear dynamics the difference in problems solving compared to conventional methods. In Newtonian problem solving (which is what the world is familiar with), we start with the facts and linearly work though time via definite steps and logical progression to arrive at the unknown (answer).

Nonlinear dynamics works the **opposite way**: from the unknown (the nondeterministic data of the question) to the known (the answer). **It operates within a different paradigm of causality**. The problem is then seen as one of definition and access, rather than a logical sequence. 

#### Attractors

Attractor is the name given to an identifiable pattern that emerges from a seemingly unmeaningful mass of data.

#### Fields of Dominance

A field of dominance is exhibited by high energy patterns in their influence over weaker ones.

#### Critical Point of Analysis

The critical point is simply the one point that, even when slightly touched, can stop the entire system. In other words: the critical point is the point where **the least force exerts the greatest effect.**

Advance theoretical physics (contributions form Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Bell, etc.) demonstrated that everything in the universe is subtly dependent upon everything else.

#### Causality

Causality as we know it follows a deterministic linear sequence A -> B -> C (A causes B, which leads to B causing C).

But in the nonlinear dynamics paradigm, the thing that causes this entire sequence (A -> B -> C) is actually **unobservable**, while the chain of reactions (A -> B -> C) *is* observable.

![](/power-versus-force1.png)

Practically speaking, this means that the typical problems that the world attempts to deal with exist on the observable level of A -> B -> C, but Hawkins is interested in finding the inherent attractor pattern *out of which* the (A -> B -> C) events arise.

One of the core concepts of chaos theory is the *the law of sensitive dependence on initial conditions*, where extremely minute variations over a course of time can have the effect of producing profound changes (e.g. a plane that's one degree off from it's destination). This phenomenon is an essential mechanism of all evolution and also underlies the potential of the creative process. 

Hawkins claims that the source of man's intellectual frustration is his attempt to "make sense" (via linear, logical, and rational methods) frequently unpredictable human behavior that's inherently nonlinear. 

## Chapter 2: History and Methodology

### Summary

#### One Sentence Summary

This chapter focuses on the technical use of the kinesiologic test.

#### One Paragraph Summary

This chapter focuses on the technical use of the kinesiologic test.


### Notes

Hawkins designs an experiment that runs 20 years across different countries and people. Basically emphasizing that the experiment was scientifically sound.

#### Historical background

The most striking findings of kinesiology is the demonstration that muscles instantly became weak when the body is exposed to harmful stimuli, while substances that were therapeutic to the body made the muscles instantly strong.

Overall, good nutrition matters for mental wellbeing.

#### The testing Technique 

The muscle test for truth can only be used with existing condition, declarative statements, rather than future inquiries.

#### Use of the Testing Procedure in This study

The technique should be used responsibly.

#### Discrepancies

People change over time, people have different sensory modalities, and values extracted will be arbitrary (unless a range is specified beforehand).

#### Limitations

10% of the population cannot use the kinesiologic test. The test is accurate only if the participant themselves calibrate over 200. Also, sometimes married couples are unable to test each other, so ideally the tester should be an independent third party.

#### Disqualifications

Skepticism and cynicism both calibrate to below 200 because they reflect negative prejudice. In contrast, true inquiry requires an open mind and honesty devoid of intellectual vanity.

> true inquiry requires an open mind and honesty devoid of intellectual vanity

Below consciousness level 200, comprehension is limited by the dominance of Lower Mind, which is capable of reorganizing facts but not yet able to grasp what is meant by the term "truth". 

## Chapter 3: Test Results and Interpretation

![](/power-force.png)
Calibrated levels correlate with specific processes of consciousness--your emotions, perceptions, attitude, worldviews, and spiritual beliefs.

The critical point in the scale of consciousness calibrates at level 200, which is the level associated with integrity and **COURAGE**.

What does this point practically mean? It means that all attitudes, thoughts, feelings, associations, entities, or historical figures below that level of calibration make a person go weak, whereas those that calibrate higher make subjects go strong.

> In other words, level 200 represents the balance point between weak and strong attractors--positive and negative influences.

The bottom two scales represent the zone of hopelessness and depression; the higher levels such as fear or anger are characterized by egocentric impulses arising from the primary impetus drive for **personal** survival.

At the level of pride, the survival motive may expand to comprehend the survival of others as well.

> As one crosses the demarcation between negative and positive influence into **COURAGE**, the well-being of **others** becomes increasingly important.

By the 500 level, the **happiness of others** emerges as the essential motivating force; the 500s are characterized by interest in spiritual awareness for both oneself and others.

By the 600 level, the good of mankind and the search for enlightenment are the primary goals. 

The last levels, between 700 to 1,000, are characterized by a life dedicated to the salvation of all humanity.

> If the hopeless (score<50) can come to desire (score = 125) something better and then use the energy of anger (score = 150) to develop pride (score = 175), they may then be able to take the step of **COURAGE** (score = 200) and proceed to improve their their individual or collective conditions.

By taking **responsibility** for the consequences of his own perceptions, the observer can transcend the role of victim to an understanding that "nothing out there has power over you". 

> It isn't life's events, **but how one reacts to them and the attitude that one has about them**, that determines whether such events have a positive or negative effect on one's life.

Nothing has the power to "create" stress. The same loud music that raises the blood pressure of one person can be a source of delight to another. A divorce may be traumatic if it's unwanted, or a release into freedom if it's desired.

Whenever force meets power, force is eventually defeated.

The key to joy is unconditional kindness to all life, including one's own, which we refer to as compassion.
