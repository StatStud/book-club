# Summary

## One Sentence Summary

## One paragraph Summary

## What is the foundational knowledge required for me to learn this?
- Reading Rollo May's "Man's search for himself" is a great prerequisite

# Reading Comprehension questions from ChatGPT

# What ACTIONS/HABITS will I partake after reading this book?

# What Questions do I have after reading this book?

# What Phrase(s) can I add/validate to my mantras?
- It isn't life's events, **but how one reacts to them and the attitude that one has about them**, that determines whether such events have a positive or negative effect on one's life.


# Foreword
In the late 1970s, Dr. John Diamond founded *behavioral kinesiology*, which revealed that indicator muscles would strengthen or weaken in the presence of positive or negative **emotional and intellectual stimuli**, the same way with physical stimuli. His findings are documented in his book "Your Body doesn't lie".

A smile, for example, will make you test strong, while the statement "I hate you" will test you weak. 

# Preface

> all pain and suffering arises solely from the ego and not from God.

> "[the students with advance spiritual disciplines] realized that they weren't at the mercy of the world, but rather were affected **only by what their minds believed**"

Perhaps the very process of progress toward enlightenment could be shown to increase man's ability to resist the mutability of existence.

> "I was more and more powerfully struck by the capacity to change things in the world by merely envisioning them"

It seemed that the great tragedy of human life has always been that the psyche is so easily deceived; discord and strife have been the inevitable consequence of mankind's inability to distinguish the false from the true. 

> "I sought to be ordinary because just being ordinary in and of itself is an expression of divinity; the truth of one's real self can be discovered through the pathway of everyday life. The common place and God aren't distinct"

To live with care and kindness is all that is necessary; the test reveals itself in due time.

Hawkin's mission is quite simple:

> "To bring the Presence that has moved my life perhaps at least a little closer to the grasp of my fellow beings as I can reach"

Hawkins describes this Presence as "silent and conveys a state of peace". With it, all hear disappears, and spiritual joy occurs on a quiet level of inexplicable ecstasy. 

Why is this the case? Because with the Presence comes the experience of time stopping; there's no apprehension, regret, pain, nor anticipation; the source of joy is unending and ever-present. With no beginning or ending, there can be no grief, loss, or desire--and nothing needs to be done, for everything is already perfect and complete.

> When time stops, all problems disappear, for they are merely artifacts of a point of perception

When the mind grows silent, the thought *I am* also disappears.

According to Hawkins, here's how we can reach this state of Presence:
1. Intense Desire
2. Discipline to act with constant and universal forgiveness and gentleness, **without exception**
    - One must be compassionate toward everything, including one's own self and thoughts
3. A willingness to hold desires in abeyance and surrender personal will at every moment 
    - As each thought, feeling, longing, or deed is surrendered to God, the mind becomes more silent
    - Eventually it becomes possible to turn over the energy behind thought itself, *before* it even became thought

> "At first this seemed very difficult, but as time went on, it became habitual, automatic, and effortless. ***The process is like a rocket leaving Earth**."

The last sentence from the above quote was my exact visualization when living alone.

The constant push and pull towards this awareness is filled with periods of feeling betrayed by a "fall from grace", and the person goes in and out of higher levels of awareness.

# Introduction

Man's dilemma has been that he misidentifies his own intellectual artifacts (products of arbitrary point of perception) as reality. 

The inadequacy of the answers we receive is a direct consequence of the limitations implicit in the viewpoints of the questioner. Information is useless unless we know what it means and the context behind it.

But not only do we need the right questions, but we also need the right tools. The faults of all thought systems have been:
1. Failure to differentiate between subjective and objective
2. Disregard of the limitation of context inherent in basic design and terminology
3. Ignorance of the nature of consciousness itself
4. Misunderstanding of the nature of causality
    - Society constantly expends its efforts to correct effects instead of causes
    - There are no causes within the observable world; the observable world is a world of effects
    - So, instead of identifying causes in the world, Hawkins suggests that the reader identify the the conditions that underlie ostensible causes; these conditions exist only within a man's consciousness itself

The basic law of the universe is economy; the universe doesn't waste a single quark; everything serves a purpose and fits into a balance--there are no extraneous events.

> The main obstacle to man's development is his lack of knowledge about the nature of consciousness itself.

The book's outline is designed to make the simple obvious; in a world where data is abundant, this is much hard to persuade people. This brings up two classes of people: believers and nonbelievers. 

To nonbelievers, everything is falsehood until proven true; to believers, everything said in good faith is probably true unless it's proven otherwise.

The pessimistic position of cynical skepticism stems from fear, while the more optimistic manner of accepting information arises from self-confidence.

This book is written in a style that makes sense to both believers and nonbelievers.

Most people read books progressively, from the first chapter to the last. But this linear style of absorbing knowledge is limiting, fixed, and outdated. 

This book undergoes the challenge of presenting this material in the paradox of comprehending nonlinear concepts in a linear, sentence-by-sentence, structure. The book accomplishes this by using man's innate pattern recognition mechanism by applying repetitions to the fundamental lessons until they become familiar.


# Part 1: Tools

## Chapter 1: Critical Advances in Knowledge


### Summary

#### One Sentence Summary

Advances in STEM fields have led to new insights into human consciousness.


#### One Paragraph Summary

Nonlinear dynamics works the **opposite way**: from the unknown (the nondeterministic data of the question) to the known (the answer). **It operates within a different paradigm of causality**. The problem is then seen as one of definition and access, rather than a logical sequence. 

### Notes

What makes kinesiology special is that it exposes the intimate connection between the mind and the body.

All paths of inquiry (philosophy, theology, etc) converge to a common point: the quest for an organized understanding of the nature of pure consciousness.

Subjective and objective are the same; the insights from the fields of study such as nonlinear dynamics, quantum physics, or AI transcend the limited viewpoint that creates the illusion of duality.

If the subjective and objective are indeed the same, then we can find the answers to all questions by merely looking **within** man himself.

By simply recording observations, we can see a grand picture emerge, one that sees no limitations with respect to further investigation.

The human mind is the most advance computer known to man, and it's freely available to man at any time and any place. The body can discern the difference between that which is supportive of life and that which is not, for all living things react positively to what is life-supporting and negatively to what is not--this is the fundamental mechanism of survival.

Inherent in **all** forms of life is the capacity to detect change and react correctively. 
- trees become smaller at high altitudes where oxygen is scarce
- long distance runners are light while sprinters are muscular

Attractor research is the field of study that concerns itself with the mapping of fields of human consciousness; it's concerned with the identification of power ranges of energy fields utilizing critical point analysis (for example, it's possible to paralyze a large windmill just by knowing where the stop switch is).

It's worth mentioning in this talk of nonlinear dynamics the difference in problems solving compared to conventional methods. In Newtonian problem solving (which is what the world is familiar with), we start with the facts and linearly work though time via definite steps and logical progression to arrive at the unknown (answer).

Nonlinear dynamics works the **opposite way**: from the unknown (the nondeterministic data of the question) to the known (the answer). **It operates within a different paradigm of causality**. The problem is then seen as one of definition and access, rather than a logical sequence. 

#### Attractors

Attractor is the name given to an identifiable pattern that emerges from a seemingly unmeaningful mass of data.

#### Fields of Dominance

A field of dominance is exhibited by high energy patterns in their influence over weaker ones.

#### Critical Point of Analysis

The critical point is simply the one point that, even when slightly touched, can stop the entire system. In other words: the critical point is the point where **the least force exerts the greatest effect.**

Advance theoretical physics (contributions form Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Bell, etc.) demonstrated that everything in the universe is subtly dependent upon everything else.

#### Causality

Causality as we know it follows a deterministic linear sequence A -> B -> C (A causes B, which leads to B causing C).

But in the nonlinear dynamics paradigm, the thing that causes this entire sequence (A -> B -> C) is actually **unobservable**, while the chain of reactions (A -> B -> C) *is* observable.

![](/power-versus-force1.png)

Practically speaking, this means that the typical problems that the world attempts to deal with exist on the observable level of A -> B -> C, but Hawkins is interested in finding the inherent attractor pattern *out of which* the (A -> B -> C) events arise.

One of the core concepts of chaos theory is the *the law of sensitive dependence on initial conditions*, where extremely minute variations over a course of time can have the effect of producing profound changes (e.g. a plane that's one degree off from it's destination). This phenomenon is an essential mechanism of all evolution and also underlies the potential of the creative process. 

Hawkins claims that the source of man's intellectual frustration is his attempt to "make sense" (via linear, logical, and rational methods) frequently unpredictable human behavior that's inherently nonlinear. 

## Chapter 2: History and Methodology

### Summary

#### One Sentence Summary

This chapter focuses on the technical use of the kinesiologic test.

#### One Paragraph Summary

This chapter focuses on the technical use of the kinesiologic test.


### Notes

Hawkins designs an experiment that runs 20 years across different countries and people. Basically emphasizing that the experiment was scientifically sound.

#### Historical background

The most striking findings of kinesiology is the demonstration that muscles instantly became weak when the body is exposed to harmful stimuli, while substances that were therapeutic to the body made the muscles instantly strong.

Overall, good nutrition matters for mental wellbeing.

#### The testing Technique 

The muscle test for truth can only be used with existing condition, declarative statements, rather than future inquiries.

#### Use of the Testing Procedure in This study

The technique should be used responsibly.

#### Discrepancies

People change over time, people have different sensory modalities, and values extracted will be arbitrary (unless a range is specified beforehand).

#### Limitations

10% of the population cannot use the kinesiologic test. The test is accurate only if the participant themselves calibrate over 200. Also, sometimes married couples are unable to test each other, so ideally the tester should be an independent third party.

#### Disqualifications

Skepticism and cynicism both calibrate to below 200 because they reflect negative prejudice. In contrast, true inquiry requires an open mind and honesty devoid of intellectual vanity.

> true inquiry requires an open mind and honesty devoid of intellectual vanity

Below consciousness level 200, comprehension is limited by the dominance of Lower Mind, which is capable of reorganizing facts but not yet able to grasp what is meant by the term "truth". 

## Chapter 3: Test Results and Interpretation

## Summary

People who operate at high levels of consciousness grow stronger, while the opposite trend happens to those who operate at lower levels. The tipping point from high and low is **COURAGE**!

## Notes

![](/power-force.png)
Calibrated levels correlate with specific processes of consciousness--your emotions, perceptions, attitude, worldviews, and spiritual beliefs.

The author stresses the importance in remembering that the calibration chart is on a **logarithmic scale**. This means that the level 300 is *not* merely twice has much as 150, but 10^(300) times as much!!

This means that an increase of even a few points represents a major advance in power; the rate of increase in power as we move up the scale in enormous.

The critical point in the scale of consciousness calibrates at level 200, which is the level associated with integrity and **COURAGE**.

What does this point practically mean? It means that all attitudes, thoughts, feelings, associations, entities, or historical figures below that level of calibration make a person go weak, whereas those that calibrate higher make subjects go strong.

All levels below 200 are destructive of life in both the individual and society at large; all levels above 200 are constructive expressions of power.

The decisive level of 200 is the fulcrum that divides the general areas of force and power.

> In other words, level 200 represents the balance point between weak and strong attractors--positive and negative influences.

The bottom two scales represent the zone of hopelessness and depression; the higher levels such as fear or anger are characterized by egocentric impulses arising from the primary impetus drive for **personal** survival.

At the level of pride, the survival motive may expand to comprehend the survival of others as well.

> As one crosses the demarcation between negative and positive influence into **COURAGE**, the well-being of **others** becomes increasingly important.

By the 500 level, the **happiness of others** emerges as the essential motivating force; the 500s are characterized by interest in spiritual awareness for both oneself and others.

By the 600 level, the good of mankind and the search for enlightenment are the primary goals. 

The last levels, between 700 to 1,000, are characterized by a life dedicated to the salvation of all humanity.

> If the hopeless (score<50) can come to desire (score = 125) something better and then use the energy of anger (score = 150) to develop pride (score = 175), they may then be able to take the step of **COURAGE** (score = 200) and proceed to improve their their individual or collective conditions.

By taking **responsibility** for the consequences of his own perceptions, the observer can transcend the role of victim to an understanding that "nothing out there has power over you". 

> It isn't life's events, **but how one reacts to them and the attitude that one has about them**, that determines whether such events have a positive or negative effect on one's life.

Nothing has the power to "create" stress. The same loud music that raises the blood pressure of one person can be a source of delight to another. A divorce may be traumatic if it's unwanted, or a release into freedom if it's desired.

Whenever force meets power, force is eventually defeated.

The key to joy is unconditional kindness to all life, including one's own, which we refer to as compassion.

## Chapter 3: Test Results and Interpretation

## Summary

## Notes

A person's level of consciousness are always mixed; they may operate at one level in a given area of life and on quite another level in another area, but their overall level of consciousness is the sum total effect of these various levels.

### Energy Level 20: Shame

Shame is perilously proximate to death, prone to physical illness, and often found with isolation. Shame-based personality is that of shy, withdrawn, and introverted.

The behavior of people whose consciousness is only in the 20s is dangerous; they're prone to hallucinations and paranoia with a high risk for neurosis.

Shame-based individuals compensate with perfectionism and rigidity, becoming driven and intolerant.

### Energy Level 30: Guilt

Masochism and victim hood are the common personality traits.

Guilt-domination results in a preoccupation with "sin"; either acting out their own guilt of sin or projecting it onto others.

Capital punishment is an example of how killing gratifies a guilt-ridden populace. 

### Energy Level 50: Apathy

This is the level of homelessness and the derelicts of society, characterized by poverty, despair, and hopelessness from a state of helplessness. It's victims are needy and lack not only resources, but the energy to avail themselves of what they may be available.

The world and future appear bleak. 

Without the will to live, the hopeless stare blankly, unresponsive to stimuli; death through passive suicide.

Society lacks sufficient motivation to be of any real help to individuals at this level because they're seen as drains of resources.

Apathy is the level of the abandonment of hope. 

### Energy Level 75: Grief

In grief, one sees sadness everywhere.

This is the level of sadness, loss, and despondency characterized by a life of constant regret and depression; it's the level of habitual losers and chronic gamblers who accept failure as part of their lifestyle, often resulting in loss of jobs, friends, family, and opportunity.

### Energy Level 100: Fear

Fear of danger is healthy, and a lot more energy is available.

Fear runs much of the world, spurring on endless activity.

Because it takes energy to rise above fear, those who are "stuck" at this level are unable to reach a higher level unaided. Thus, the fearful seek strong leaders who appear to have conquered their own fears to lead them out of its slavery.

### Energy Level 125: Desire

Even more energy is available at this level. Desire motivates vast areas of human activity, especially the economy. Desire moves us to expend great effort to achieve goals or obtain rewards.

The desire for money, prestige, or power runs the lives of many of those who have risen above fear as their predominant life motif.

Desire is also the level of addiction, wherein it becomes a craving more important than life itself.

Desire has to do with accumulation and greed. 

### Energy Level 150: Anger

Anger can lead to either constructive or destructive action. 

Anger can be a fulcrum by which the oppressed are eventually catapulted to freedom.

Anger can also manifest itself as resentment and revenge, thereby becoming volatile and dangerous.

Since anger stems from frustrated wants, it's based on the energy level field below it. Frustration results from exaggerating the importance of desires.

### Energy Level 175: Pride

At a calibration of 175, pride has enough energy to run the United States Marine Corps.

In contrast to the lower energy fields, people feel positive as they reach this level.

But, it's under the threshold of 200 because "pride goeth before a fall"; pride is defensive and vulnerable because it's dependent upon external conditions, without which it can suddenly revert to a lower level.

The inflated ego is, for example, a vulnerable spot. Pride remains weak because it can be knocked off its pedestal back to shame, which in turn is the threat that fires the fear of loss and pride.

### Energy Level 200: COURAGE!

Power finally appears.

All participants at energy levels below 200 go weak, but everyone goes strong in response to the life-supporting fields above 200.

**COURAGE** is the critical line that distinguishes between positive and negative influences in life. 

**COURAGE** is the zone of exploration, accomplishment, fortitude, and determination.

At the levels below **COURAGE**, the world is seen as hopeless, sad, frightening, or frustrating. But upon attaining **COURAGE** life is seen to be exciting, challenging, stimulating, and rewarding.

**COURAGE** implies the willingness to try new things and deal with the changes and challenges of life.

With **COURAGE** the person has the energy to learn new job skills. Growth and education become attainable goals. **COURAGE** is the capacity to face fears or character defects and to grow despite them.

People at this level put back into the world as much energy as they take; at lower levels, populations as well as individuals drain energy from society without reciprocating. 

### Energy Level 250: Neutrality

Neutrality seeks to remove the barriers of overprotection and polarizing divisions by seeking to remain open; the neutral condition allows for flexibility and nonjudgmental, realistic appraisals of problems.

To be neutral means to be relatively detached to outcomes; not getting one's way is no longer experienced as defeating, frightening, or frustrating.

A person who is neutral will say, "Well, if I don't get this job, then I'll just get another".

This is the beginning of **inner strength**; sensing one's power, one isn't easily intimidated or driven to prove anything. 

It's the world view that, in spite of the ups and downs of life, things will basically be okay, if one can surf the waves of chaos.

People at this level are easy to get along with and safe to be around and associate with because they're not interested in conflict, competition, or guilt; they're comfortable and basically undisturbed emotionally.

These people recognize and value freedom, and thus are difficult to control.

### Energy Level 310: Willingness

At the neutral level, jobs are done adequately, but at the level of willingness, work is done well and success in all endeavors is common.

Willingness implies that one has overcome inner resistance to life and is committed to participation. People who are willing are genuinely friendly, and social and economic success is abundant for them.
