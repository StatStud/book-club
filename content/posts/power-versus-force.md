# Foreword
In the late 1970s, Dr. John Diamond founded *behavioral kinesiology*, which revealed that indicator muscles would strengthen or weaken in the presence of positive or negative **emotional and intellectual stimuli**, the same way with physical stimuli. His findings are documented in his book "Your Body doesn't lie".

A smile, for example, will make you test strong, while the statement "I hate you" will test you weak. 

# Preface

> all pain and suffering arises solely from the ego and not from God.

> "[the students with advance spiritual disciplines] realized that they weren't at the mercy of the world, but rather were affected **only by what their minds believed**"

Perhaps the very process of progress toward enlightenment could be shown to increase man's ability to resist the mutability of existence.

> "I was more and more powerfully struck by the capacity to change things in the world by merely envisioning them"

It seemed that the great tragedy of human life has always been that the psyche is so easily deceived; discord and strife have been the inevitable consequence of mankind's inability to distinguish the false from the true. 

> "I sought to be ordinary because just being ordinary in and of itself is an expression of divinity; the truth of one's real self can be discovered through the pathway of everyday life. The common place and God aren't distinct"

To live with care and kindness is all that is necessary; the test reveals itself in due time.

Hawkin's mission is quite simple:

> "To bring the Presence that has moved my life perhaps at least a little closer to the grasp of my fellow beings as I can reach"

Hawkins describes this Presence as "silent and conveys a state of peace". With it, all hear disappears, and spiritual joy occurs on a quiet level of inexplicable ecstasy. 

Why is this the case? Because with the Presence comes the experience of time stopping; there's no apprehension, regret, pain, nor anticipation; the source of joy is unending and ever-present. With no beginning or ending, there can be no grief, loss, or desire--and nothing needs to be done, for everything is already perfect and complete.

> When time stops, all problems disappear, for they are merely artifacts of a point of perception

When the mind grows silent, the thought *I am* also disappears.

According to Hawkins, here's how we can reach this state of Presence:
1. Intense Desire
2. Discipline to act with constant and universal forgiveness and gentleness, **without exception**
    - One must be compassionate toward everything, including one's own self and thoughts
3. A willingness to hold desires in abeyance and surrender personal will at every moment 
    - As each thought, feeling, longing, or deed is surrendered to God, the mind becomes more silent
    - Eventually it becomes possible to turn over the energy behind thought itself, *before* it even became thought

> "At first this seemed very difficult, but as time went on, it became habitual, automatic, and effortless. ***The process is like a rocket leaving Earth**."

The last sentence from the above quote was my exact visualization when living alone.

The constant push and pull towards this awareness is filled with periods of feeling betrayed by a "fall from grace", and the person goes in and out of higher levels of awareness.

# Introduction

Man's dilemma has been that he misidentifies his own intellectual artifacts (products of arbitrary point of perception) as reality. 

The inadequacy of the answers we receive is a direct consequence of the limitations implicit in the viewpoints of the questioner. Information is useless unless we know what it means and the context behind it.

But not only do we need the right questions, but we also need the right tools. The faults of all thought systems have been:
1. Failure to differentiate between subjective and objective
2. Disregard of the limitation of context inherent in basic design and terminology
3. Ignorance of the nature of consciousness itself
4. Misunderstanding of the nature of causality
    - Society constantly expends its efforts to correct effects instead of causes
    - There are no causes within the observable world; the observable world is a world of effects
    - So, instead of identifying causes in the world, Hawkins suggests that the reader identify the the conditions that underlie ostensible causes; these conditions exist only within a man's consciousness itself

The basic law of the universe is economy; the universe doesn't waste a single quark; everything serves a purpose and fits into a balance--there are no extraneous events.

> The main obstacle to man's development is his lack of knowledge about the nature of consciousness itself.

The book's outline is designed to make the simple obvious; in a world where data is abundant, this is much hard to persuade people. This brings up two classes of people: believers and nonbelievers. 

To nonbelievers, everything is falsehood until proven true; to believers, everything said in good faith is probably true unless it's proven otherwise.

The pessimistic position of cynical skepticism stems from fear, while the more optimistic manner of accepting information arises from self-confidence.

This book is written in a style that makes sense to both believers and nonbelievers.

Most people read books progressively, from the first chapter to the last. But this linear style of absorbing knowledge is limiting, fixed, and outdated. 

This book undergoes the challenge of presenting this material in the paradox of comprehending nonlinear concepts in a linear, sentence-by-sentence, structure. The book accomplishes this by using man's innate pattern recognition mechanism by applying repetitions to the fundamental lessons until they become familiar.


# Part 1: Tools

## Chapter 1: Critical Advances in Knowledge


### Summary

#### One Sentence Summary

Advances in STEM fields have led to new insights into human consciousness.


#### One Paragraph Summary

Nonlinear dynamics works the **opposite way**: from the unknown (the nondeterministic data of the question) to the known (the answer). **It operates within a different paradigm of causality**. The problem is then seen as one of definition and access, rather than a logical sequence. 

### Notes

What makes kinesiology special is that it exposes the intimate connection between the mind and the body.

All paths of inquiry (philosophy, theology, etc) converge to a common point: the quest for an organized understanding of the nature of pure consciousness.

Subjective and objective are the same; the insights from the fields of study such as nonlinear dynamics, quantum physics, or AI transcend the limited viewpoint that creates the illusion of duality.

If the subjective and objective are indeed the same, then we can find the answers to all questions by merely looking **within** man himself.

By simply recording observations, we can see a grand picture emerge, one that sees no limitations with respect to further investigation.

The human mind is the most advance computer known to man, and it's freely available to man at any time and any place. The body can discern the difference between that which is supportive of life and that which is not, for all living things react positively to what is life-supporting and negatively to what is not--this is the fundamental mechanism of survival.

Inherent in **all** forms of life is the capacity to detect change and react correctively. 
- trees become smaller at high altitudes where oxygen is scarce
- long distance runners are light while sprinters are muscular

Attractor research is the field of study that concerns itself with the mapping of fields of human consciousness; it's concerned with the identification of power ranges of energy fields utilizing critical point analysis (for example, it's possible to paralyze a large windmill just by knowing where the stop switch is).

It's worth mentioning in this talk of nonlinear dynamics the difference in problems solving compared to conventional methods. In Newtonian problem solving (which is what the world is familiar with), we start with the facts and linearly work though time via definite steps and logical progression to arrive at the unknown (answer).

Nonlinear dynamics works the **opposite way**: from the unknown (the nondeterministic data of the question) to the known (the answer). **It operates within a different paradigm of causality**. The problem is then seen as one of definition and access, rather than a logical sequence. 

#### Attractors

Attractor is the name given to an identifiable pattern that emerges from a seemingly unmeaningful mass of data.

#### Fields of Dominance

A field of dominance is exhibited by high energy patterns in their influence over weaker ones.

#### Critical Point of Analysis

The critical point is simply the one point that, even when slightly touched, can stop the entire system. In other words: the critical point is the point where **the least force exerts the greatest effect.**

Advance theoretical physics (contributions form Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Bell, etc.) demonstrated that everything in the universe is subtly dependent upon everything else.

#### Causality

Causality as we know it follows a deterministic linear sequence A -> B -> C (A causes B, which leads to B causing C).

But in the nonlinear dynamics paradigm, the thing that causes this entire sequence (A -> B -> C) is actually **unobservable**, while the chain of reactions (A -> B -> C) *is* observable.

![](/power-versus-force1.png)

Practically speaking, this means that the typical problems that the world attempts to deal with exist on the observable level of A -> B -> C, but Hawkins is interested in finding the inherent attractor pattern *out of which* the (A -> B -> C) events arise.

One of the core concepts of chaos theory is the *the law of sensitive dependence on initial conditions*, where extremely minute variations over a course of time can have the effect of producing profound changes (e.g. a plane that's one degree off from it's destination). This phenomenon is an essential mechanism of all evolution and also underlies the potential of the creative process. 

Hawkins claims that the source of man's intellectual frustration is his attempt to "make sense" (via linear, logical, and rational methods) frequently unpredictable human behavior that's inherently nonlinear. 

## Chapter 2: History and Methodology

### Summary

#### One Sentence Summary

This chapter focuses on the technical use of the kinesiologic test.

#### One Paragraph Summary

This chapter focuses on the technical use of the kinesiologic test.


### Notes

Hawkins designs an experiment that runs 20 years across different countries and people. Basically emphasizing that the experiment was scientifically sound.

#### Historical background

The most striking findings of kinesiology is the demonstration that muscles instantly became weak when the body is exposed to harmful stimuli, while substances that were therapeutic to the body made the muscles instantly strong.

Overall, good nutrition matters for mental wellbeing.

#### The testing Technique 

The muscle test for truth can only be used with existing condition, declarative statements, rather than future inquiries.

#### Use of the Testing Procedure in This study

The technique should be used responsibly.

#### Discrepancies

People change over time, people have different sensory modalities, and values extracted will be arbitrary (unless a range is specified beforehand).

#### Limitations

10% of the population cannot use the kinesiologic test. The test is accurate only if the participant themselves calibrate over 200. Also, sometimes married couples are unable to test each other, so ideally the tester should be an independent third party.

#### Disqualifications

Skepticism and cynicism both calibrate to below 200 because they reflect negative prejudice. In contrast, true inquiry requires an open mind and honesty devoid of intellectual vanity.

> true inquiry requires an open mind and honesty devoid of intellectual vanity

Below consciousness level 200, comprehension is limited by the dominance of Lower Mind, which is capable of reorganizing facts but not yet able to grasp what is meant by the term "truth". 

## Chapter 3: Test Results and Interpretation

## Summary

People who operate at high levels of consciousness grow stronger, while the opposite trend happens to those who operate at lower levels. The tipping point from high and low is **COURAGE**!

## Notes

![](/power-force.png)
Calibrated levels correlate with specific processes of consciousness--your emotions, perceptions, attitude, worldviews, and spiritual beliefs.

The author stresses the importance in remembering that the calibration chart is on a **logarithmic scale**. This means that the level 300 is *not* merely twice has much as 150, but 10^(300) times as much!!

This means that an increase of even a few points represents a major advance in power; the rate of increase in power as we move up the scale in enormous.

The critical point in the scale of consciousness calibrates at level 200, which is the level associated with integrity and **COURAGE**.

What does this point practically mean? It means that all attitudes, thoughts, feelings, associations, entities, or historical figures below that level of calibration make a person go weak, whereas those that calibrate higher make subjects go strong.

All levels below 200 are destructive of life in both the individual and society at large; all levels above 200 are constructive expressions of power.

The decisive level of 200 is the fulcrum that divides the general areas of force and power.

> In other words, level 200 represents the balance point between weak and strong attractors--positive and negative influences.

The bottom two scales represent the zone of hopelessness and depression; the higher levels such as fear or anger are characterized by egocentric impulses arising from the primary impetus drive for **personal** survival.

At the level of pride, the survival motive may expand to comprehend the survival of others as well.

> As one crosses the demarcation between negative and positive influence into **COURAGE**, the well-being of **others** becomes increasingly important.

By the 500 level, the **happiness of others** emerges as the essential motivating force; the 500s are characterized by interest in spiritual awareness for both oneself and others.

By the 600 level, the good of mankind and the search for enlightenment are the primary goals. 

The last levels, between 700 to 1,000, are characterized by a life dedicated to the salvation of all humanity.

> If the hopeless (score<50) can come to desire (score = 125) something better and then use the energy of anger (score = 150) to develop pride (score = 175), they may then be able to take the step of **COURAGE** (score = 200) and proceed to improve their their individual or collective conditions.

By taking **responsibility** for the consequences of his own perceptions, the observer can transcend the role of victim to an understanding that "nothing out there has power over you". 

> It isn't life's events, **but how one reacts to them and the attitude that one has about them**, that determines whether such events have a positive or negative effect on one's life.

Nothing has the power to "create" stress. The same loud music that raises the blood pressure of one person can be a source of delight to another. A divorce may be traumatic if it's unwanted, or a release into freedom if it's desired.

Whenever force meets power, force is eventually defeated.

The key to joy is unconditional kindness to all life, including one's own, which we refer to as compassion.

## Chapter 3: Test Results and Interpretation

### Summary

### Notes

## Chapter 4: Levels of Human Consciousness 

A person's level of consciousness are always mixed; they may operate at one level in a given area of life and on quite another level in another area, but their overall level of consciousness is the sum total effect of these various levels.

### Energy Level 20: Shame

Shame is perilously proximate to death, prone to physical illness, and often found with isolation. Shame-based personality is that of shy, withdrawn, and introverted.

The behavior of people whose consciousness is only in the 20s is dangerous; they're prone to hallucinations and paranoia with a high risk for neurosis.

Shame-based individuals compensate with perfectionism and rigidity, becoming driven and intolerant.

### Energy Level 30: Guilt

Masochism and victim hood are the common personality traits.

Guilt-domination results in a preoccupation with "sin"; either acting out their own guilt of sin or projecting it onto others.

Capital punishment is an example of how killing gratifies a guilt-ridden populace. 

### Energy Level 50: Apathy

This is the level of homelessness and the derelicts of society, characterized by poverty, despair, and hopelessness from a state of helplessness. It's victims are needy and lack not only resources, but the energy to avail themselves of what they may be available.

The world and future appear bleak. 

Without the will to live, the hopeless stare blankly, unresponsive to stimuli; death through passive suicide.

Society lacks sufficient motivation to be of any real help to individuals at this level because they're seen as drains of resources.

Apathy is the level of the abandonment of hope. 

### Energy Level 75: Grief

In grief, one sees sadness everywhere.

This is the level of sadness, loss, and despondency characterized by a life of constant regret and depression; it's the level of habitual losers and chronic gamblers who accept failure as part of their lifestyle, often resulting in loss of jobs, friends, family, and opportunity.

### Energy Level 100: Fear

Fear of danger is healthy, and a lot more energy is available.

Fear runs much of the world, spurring on endless activity.

Because it takes energy to rise above fear, those who are "stuck" at this level are unable to reach a higher level unaided. Thus, the fearful seek strong leaders who appear to have conquered their own fears to lead them out of its slavery.

### Energy Level 125: Desire

Even more energy is available at this level. Desire motivates vast areas of human activity, especially the economy. Desire moves us to expend great effort to achieve goals or obtain rewards.

The desire for money, prestige, or power runs the lives of many of those who have risen above fear as their predominant life motif.

Desire is also the level of addiction, wherein it becomes a craving more important than life itself.

Desire has to do with accumulation and greed. 

### Energy Level 150: Anger

Anger can lead to either constructive or destructive action. 

Anger can be a fulcrum by which the oppressed are eventually catapulted to freedom.

Anger can also manifest itself as resentment and revenge, thereby becoming volatile and dangerous.

Since anger stems from frustrated wants, it's based on the energy level field below it. Frustration results from exaggerating the importance of desires.

### Energy Level 175: Pride

At a calibration of 175, pride has enough energy to run the United States Marine Corps.

In contrast to the lower energy fields, people feel positive as they reach this level.

But, it's under the threshold of 200 because "pride goeth before a fall"; pride is defensive and vulnerable because it's dependent upon external conditions, without which it can suddenly revert to a lower level.

The inflated ego is, for example, a vulnerable spot. Pride remains weak because it can be knocked off its pedestal back to shame, which in turn is the threat that fires the fear of loss and pride.

### Energy Level 200: COURAGE!

Power finally appears.

All participants at energy levels below 200 go weak, but everyone goes strong in response to the life-supporting fields above 200.

**COURAGE** is the critical line that distinguishes between positive and negative influences in life. 

**COURAGE** is the zone of exploration, accomplishment, fortitude, and determination.

At the levels below **COURAGE**, the world is seen as hopeless, sad, frightening, or frustrating. But upon attaining **COURAGE** life is seen to be exciting, challenging, stimulating, and rewarding.

**COURAGE** implies the willingness to try new things and deal with the changes and challenges of life.

With **COURAGE** the person has the energy to learn new job skills. Growth and education become attainable goals. **COURAGE** is the capacity to face fears or character defects and to grow despite them.

People at this level put back into the world as much energy as they take; at lower levels, populations as well as individuals drain energy from society without reciprocating. 

### Energy Level 250: Neutrality

Neutrality seeks to remove the barriers of overprotection and polarizing divisions by seeking to remain open; the neutral condition allows for flexibility and nonjudgmental, realistic appraisals of problems.

To be neutral means to be relatively detached to outcomes; not getting one's way is no longer experienced as defeating, frightening, or frustrating.

A person who is neutral will say, "Well, if I don't get this job, then I'll just get another".

This is the beginning of **inner strength**; sensing one's power, one isn't easily intimidated or driven to prove anything. 

It's the world view that, in spite of the ups and downs of life, things will basically be okay, if one can surf the waves of chaos.

People at this level are easy to get along with and safe to be around and associate with because they're not interested in conflict, competition, or guilt; they're comfortable and basically undisturbed emotionally.

These people recognize and value freedom, and thus are difficult to control.

### Energy Level 310: Willingness

At the neutral level, jobs are done adequately, but at the level of willingness, work is done well and success in all endeavors is common.

Willingness implies that one has overcome inner resistance to life and is committed to participation. People who are willing are genuinely friendly, and social and economic success is abundant for them.

### Energy Level 350: Acceptance

The level of awareness where one understands that he is both the *source* **and** *creator* of the experience of one's life.

Taking such responsibility is distinctive of this degree of evolution, characterized by the capacity to live harmoniously with the forces of life.

All people below level 200 tend to be powerless and see themselves as victims who are at the mercy of life, stemming from the belief or mental narrative that the source of one's happiness or the cause of one's problems is "out there". 

But at level 350, an enormous jump takes place: the person takes back his power, with the realization that the source of happiness is within himself.

He realizes that, in this more evolved state, nothing "out there" has the capacity to make one happy, **and love isn't something that's given or taken away by another, but created from within.**

Side note: holy actual shit, I've arrived at this same damn thinking!

Acceptance is different from passivity. Acceptance allows engagement in life on life's own terms, without trying to make conform to an agenda.

There's an emotional calm with with acceptance, and perception is widened as denial is transcended.

One now sees things without distortion or misinterpretation; one is able to see the whole picture.

The individual at the level of acceptance isn't interested in determining right or wrong, but instead is dedicated to resolving issues and finding out what to do about problems. 

Tough jobs don't cause discomfort or dismay. Long-term goals take precedence over short-term ones. Self-discipline and mastery are prominent.

### Energy level 400: Reason

Reason is capable of handling large, complex, amounts of data and making rapid, correct, decisions, and of understanding the intricacies of relationships, gradations, and fine distinctions.

Expert manipulation of symbols as abstract concepts becomes increasingly important, for this is the level of science, medicine, and of generally increased capacity for conceptualization and comprehension.

Knowledge and education are sought as capital, and understanding and information are the main tools of accomplishment.

This is the level of Nobel Prize winners, great statesmen, and supreme court justices.

Einstein, Freud, and many other greats are celebrated here.

However, the shortcomings of this level involve the failure to distinguish the difference objective reality and subjective symbols that limits the understanding of causality. It becomes easy to be trapped by the theories and miss the essential point--the forest for the trees.

Reason itself does not provide a guide to truth. It does produce massive amounts of information and documentation, but lacks the capacity to resolve discrepancies in data and conclusions.

Reason itself, paradoxically, is the major block to reaching higher levels of consciousness.

### Energy Level 500: Love

What the world generally regards as love is an intense emotional condition, combining physical attraction, addition, control, eroticism, and novelty.

But level 500 love is characterized by the development of a love that is unconditional, unchanging, and permanent. It doesn't fluctuate. It's source isn't dependent on external factors. Love is a state of being. It's a forgiving nature. 

This love is not intellectual, nor does it proceed form the mind; this love emanates from the heart.

It has the capacity to lift others up and accomplish great feats because of its purity of motive.

### Energy Level 540: Joy

As love becomes more and more unconditional, it begins to be experienced as inner joy. It's a constant accompaniment to all activities. This joy arises from *within* each moment of existence, rather than from any other source.

This level is marked by the capacity for enormous patience and the persistence of a positive attitude in the face of prolonged adversity--with compassion as the hallmark capacity.

### Energy Level 600: Peace

The realization that everything is connected

### Energy Level 700-1,000: Enlightenment

People like Buddha, Jesus, etc.

## Chapter 5: Social Distribution of Consciousness Levels

### Summary 

Advancing one's consciousness is rare, but possible, through individual freedom of his own choice. Above all else, it will be a matter of will.

### Notes

A distribution of the energy levels of the world's population would resemble a pagoda roof (japanese roof with a curve; basically the author is saying that the distribution looks like a valley with two extreme peaks at the opposite ends), wherein 85% of the human race calibrates below the critical level of 200. Today, the average consciousness level stands at about 207.

The power of the relatively few individuals near the top counterbalances the weakness of the masses toward the bottom to achieve this overall state.

Only 4% of the world's population calibrates at a level of at least 500; 0.4% calibrates to at least 540; and only 1 in a million calibrates to 600 or higher.

We must realize that much of the remainder of the world's population (particularly developing countries) primarily live in fear due to political instability, famines, diseases, natural disasters, and other chaotic events.

The majority of humans spend their lives in a quest for one form of security or another.

But here in the developed world, where resources are plentiful and there are a lack of natural predators, people transcend the imperative of survival and become desire-driven, and success in attaining these desires leads at best to pride.

Any meaningful human satisfaction cannot even commence until the level of 250, where some degree of self-confidence begins to emerge as a basis for positive life experiences in the evolution of consciousness.

#### Cultural Correlations

Energy levels below 200 are most common in extremely primitive conditions, where life is only a little more than animal existence.

The high 200s are represented by skilled labor, blue-collar workers, tradesmen, and industries.

300s are marked by upper management, artisans, and educators.

400s are the level of the awakening of the intellect. The home exhibits full bookcases to encourage mass literacy. There's an interest in more educational TV, and more sophisticated political awareness. Recreational activities take the form of chess, travel, theater, and concerts. **Education is the underpinning of this level**. Consequently, individuals tend to gather in metropolitan areas where they have access to sources of information and instruction, such as universities. Einstein, Newton, Freud, and Descartes are calibrated at 499.

Just as 200 is the critical change of consciousness, so does the level 500 mark the critical change at which awareness makes another giant leap. 500s in the mark of excellence in every field of human endeavor. Altruism becomes a motivating factor, along with dedication to principles. Leadership is accepted rather than sought.

And of course, those who reach even higher levels stonish their friends and families with sudden breakthroughs into new, subjective, contexts of reality. Consciousness at this level can be described as vision and may focus on uplifting society as a whole.

#### Progression of Consciousness

As outlined in the previous chapter, there are many levels to consciousness, however it is *uncommon* for people to move from one level to another during their lifetimes; the energy field that is calibrated at birth only increases, on average, by about 5 points. Consciousness itself evolves very slowly through innumerable generations.

The majority of people utilize their life experiences to elaborate and express the **variations** of their n**ative energy field**; it's the rare individual who manages to move beyond it.

What defines one's level is **motivation**; motivation proceeds from meaning, and meaning, in turn, is an expression in context. Thus, achievement is bounded by context which, when aligned with motivation, determines the individual's relative power.

Unfortunately, some people's cumulative life choices many times result in a net *lowering* of their level of consciousness. It is the influence of a very few individuals of advance consciousness that counterbalances entire populations at the lower levels. And other times, the extreme negativity of a few individuals can sway entire cultures and produce a global drag on the general level of consciousness (history rhymes). Only 2.6% of the human population accounts for 72% of society's problems.

Nevertheless, in spite of what the average person may achieve, it's still possible to make sudden positive jumps, leaping up even hundreds of points, if: 
1. one can truly escape the egocentric draw of sub-200 attractor fields
    - in my personal case, this means moving away from my negative consumption habits
2. Consciously choosing friendly, earnest, kind, and forgiving approach to life
3. Making charity toward others their primary focus

Higher levels can certainly be attained. In practice, great **WILL** is required ("what he has above all else is **WILL**").

Thus, although it is not ordinary to move out of one energy field into another during one's lifetime, the opportunity still exists. It remains for motivation to activate potential.

> **Without the exercise of choice, no progression will occur.**

It's important to keep in mind that the progression of the calibrated power is logarithmic; thus, individual choice can have a mighty effect. For instance, the difference between 361.0 and 361.1 is very meaningful and capable of transforming both one's life and one's effect on the world at large.


## Chapter 6: New Horizons in Research

### Summary

The common belief is that it's the substance itself to which the victim has become addicted, due to the substance's power to create a "high" state of euphoria. But this so-called "high" is merely the suppression of the lower energy fields, thereby allowing the user temporary access to higher energy levels. The suppression of lower energies doesn't *create* higher ones; it merely reveals them, briefly. It is to this experience of seeking that exposed higher level that people become addicted.

### Notes

#### Social Problems

Drug, porn, and alcohol addition is a crucial social concern that feeds the parallel problems of crime, poverty, and welfare. 

> The common belief is that it's the substance itself to which the victim has become addicted, due to the substance's power to create a "high" state of euphoria. But this so-called "high" is merely the suppression of the lower energy fields, thereby allowing the user temporary access to higher energy levels. The suppression of lower energies doesn't *create* higher ones; it merely reveals them, briefly. It is to this experience of seeking that exposed higher level that people become addicted.

Side note: Wow! This is so insightful!

Within the levels of consciousness, the higher frequencies are extremely powerful, and few people routinely experience them as pure states because they're masked by lower energy fields of anxiety, fear, anger, resentment, and so on. But, these states are so powerful that once they have been experienced, they are never forgotten, and therefore, are sought after again.

The high state that people seek is in fact the experience field of their own consciousness (Self). 

If such people are spiritually naive, they believe that experience is created from something "out there" (external things such as love, drugs, music, guru, etc.).  But all that has actually happened something "in here", within themselves.

> A "high" is any state of consciousness above one's customary level of awareness

For example, a person who lives in fear will find a "high" by acting through anger as a protester, because to some degree he feels in control of his situation as well. Likewise, love makes any lower state feel comparatively unattractive, while joy surpasses all lesser human emotions.

The higher the attainment of each of these states, the greater its power to reprogram the subjects' entire life.

Just one instant in a very high state can completely change a person's orientation to life, as well as his goals and values.

Through hard-won progress on a dedicated spiritual path, this is the very mechanism of spiritual evolution.

The permanent high-state experience that may be legitimately attained only through a lifetime of dedicated inner work, *can* be reached via artificial means (i.e. external substances), but only temporarily.

But, the balance of nature dictates that to artificially acquire such a state, without earning it creates a debt, and the negative imbalance results in negative consequences. The cost of such stolen pleasure is the desperation of addiction, and finally, both the addict and society pay the price.

Especially in modern times, with "cheap dopamine", our society idealizes pleasure, while hard work, stoicism, self-sacrifice, and restraint all take a back seat.

Historically speaking, all ruling classes have achieved status and wealth by controlling society through some form of puritanical ethic. 

#### Industrial and Scientific Research

The kinesiology test could have been used to help Edison progress much faster to finding the right materials by simply grouping materials into groups and asking binary questions, and then further subdividing groups until the answer has been reached.


## Chapter 7: Everyday Critical Point Analysis

In regard to the kinesiology test, the calibrated power of an identified attractor is directly related to its level of truth; this means we can clearly distinguish true from false from any inquiry. This works because consciousness reacts decisively to the difference between truth and falsehood. This permits us to identify the level of truth of any statement, belief system, or body of knowledge.

Like a computer, consciousness simply answers in binary true or false.


We discover the truth about ourselves because our questions are themselves merely the reflections of our own motives, goals, and level of awareness.

As you might imagine, precision in wording is of paramount importance when doing the test. Questions must be clearly and objectively defined. Before even asking the question, your first inquiry should be "I may ask this question?" (yes or no response).

The author points out a variety of creative ways of using the kinesiology test in domains like:
- Current events
- Health research
- Criminal investigators
- Statistics
- Politics
- Commerce
- Science and research 
- Clinical work
- Education 
- Spirituality

All limiting definitions create fear because they create vulnerability; our perceptions are essentially distorted by our own self-definition, which in turn is qualified by identifying with out limitations.

Error occurs when we cling to the belief that "I am *that*".

Truth is unveiled when we see that one *has* "that" or *does* "that", instead of *is* "that".

Once fear of death is transcended, life becomes a transformed experience because that particular fear underlies all others.

Few people know what it is to live without fear, but beyond fear lies joy, as the meaning and purpose of existence become transparent.

Once this realization occurs, life becomes effortless and the sources of suffering dissolved; suffering is only the price we pay for our attachments.

Certainly, in the realm of spirituality, there are many fake gurus, so here's how you can tell if you're dealing with a real teacher:

> A universal hallmark of a true teacher is that they never control anyone's life in any way; instead, they merely explain *how* to advance one's own consciousness. It's also important to note that true teachers neither seek nor desire material gain because beyond the level 500 consciousness, possessions and worldly needs irrelevant.


Appropriate use of the system will always lead to self-discovery and growth. Eventually, it can lead us to have compassion for everyone, when we see how we all must struggle with the downside of human nature.

Everyone is crippled in some area, and each of us is somewhere on the path of evolution--some people are ahead and some people are behind.

Everyone has chosen his own level of consciousness, yet nobody could have done otherwise at any given point in time; we can only get "there" from "here".

Pain exists to promote evolution; its cumulative effect finally forces us in a new direction, although the mechanism may be very slow.

> That which is injurious loses its capacity to harm when it's brought into the light

In this interconnected universe, every improvement we make in our private world improves the world at large for everyone.

Simple kindness to one's self and all that lives is the most powerful transformation force of all, for it produces no backlash, has no downside, and never leads to loss nor despair. It increases one's own true power without exacting any toll.

We attract what we are.

All avenues of questioning lead to the same ultimate answer: the discovery that nothing is hidden and truth stands everywhere revealed is the key to enlightenment about the simplest practical affairs and the destiny of mankind.

> In the process of examining our everyday lives, we can find that all of our fears have been based on falsehood.

## Chapter 8: The Source of Power

The source of power for the American constitution is the claim that all men are created equal by virtue of the divinity of their creation, and human rights are intrinsic to human creation and therefore inalienable.

### Summary

Power arises from meaning that is life sustaining and appeals to what uplifts, dignifies, and ennobles. It is meaning, and the maps of meaning, that connect the invisible universe with the physical, observable one. 

The comparison between force and power is the same with that of Scott Adams' goals versus systems; force consumes energy to reach a goal but then remain empty after achieving the goal, whereas power is continuously reaching ever-higher levels of dense inner fulfillment.



### Power versus Force

> Power arises from *meaning*

It has to do with motive and it has to do with principle.

Power is **always** associated with that which supports the significance of life itself; it appeals to the part of human nature which we call *nobel*.

Force, in contrast, appeals to what we call *crass*. It is concrete, literal, and arguable. It requires proof and support.

Power appeals to what uplifts, dignifies, and ennobles. 

> Force must always be justified, whereas power requires no justification

For example, power is meaning to do with the significance of life; health is self-evidently more important than disease, as well as how honor is preferable over dishonor and faith and trust are preferred to doubt and fear. This self-evidence is not arguable and not subject to justification. 

Force always creates an equal but opposite counterforce, so its effect is limited by the laws of physics; this counterforce is polarizing, rather than unifying. This polarization always implies conflict and a win/lose dichotomy. Because somebody always loses, it creates enemies. Constantly faced with enemies, force requires defense, and this defensively is costly over the long run.

Power, on the other hand, is still, much like how gravity exists to pull things.

Force is always moving against something, whereas power doesn't move against anything at all.

Force is incomplete and therefore has to be fed energy constantly. Power is total and complete in itself and requires nothing from outside. Power has no demands and no needs.

Force consumes, whereas power energizes and gives.

Power is associated with compassion and makes us feel good, whereas force is associated with judgement and makes us feel poorly about ourselves.

Every civilization is characterized by native principles. If these principles are nobel, it succeeds; if they're selfish, it falls.

Similar to what Scott Adams compares between goals and systems-oriented people, Force has transient goals that, when reached, inner hollowness and meaninglessness remains. Power, on the other hand, motivates us endlessly.

> That's why service is others is the pinnacle of the most fulfilling life: if our lives are dedicated to enhancing the welfare of everyone we contact, our lives can never lose meaning.

If the purpose of life is financial success, what happens after it has been attained? This is one of the primary causes of depression in middle-aged men and women.

> The disillusion of emptiness comes from failing to align one's life with the principles from which power originates. Power originates from meaning that is life sustaining, appealing to what uplifts, dignifies, and ennobles.

Alignment with that which is beautiful, nobel, and uplifting is associated with longevity and vigor, because beauty is a function of creativity.

### New Paradigms

Whereas much of science is based on the philosophy of real being quantifiable, the sources of power are invisible and intangible.

> Force can bring satisfaction, but only power brings joy. Victory over others brings satisfaction, but victory over *ourselves* brings us joy.

### Chaos Theory

The study of nonlinear dynamics has verified that there really is no chaos in the universe; the appearance of disorder is merely a function of the limits of perception.

We make our choices from values, and values are associated with intrinsic patterns.

It's one thing to conceive of the Empire State Building; it's something else to make it happen. To make a thing happen requires motivation, and motivation is derived from meaning. Therefore, the visible and invisible worlds are linked together.

![](/power-versus-force1.png)

We might say that the right brain "gets the pattern" and the left brain "makes it visible".

An ABC may either be high-energy attractor or a lower-energy one; certain meanings and values have greater power than others.

> Simply stated, powerful attractor patterns make us go strong, and weak pattern attractors make us go weak.

> All great teachers, from Jesus to Buddha, have said the same thing over and over again: give up weak attractors for strong ones.
