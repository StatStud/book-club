# Summary

# Introduction
"Use what's helpful, let go of the rest"
# Everyone is a creator
Creativity is not just limited to art or music. We engage in creative acts everyday, whether it be the conversations we partake in, the paths we take to work, or the letter that we write to a friend.

To be creative is to be a creator; to create something into existence that was not previously available.

To live as an artist is a way of *being* in the world. A way of perceiving. A practice of paying attention.
# Tuning In
The world is abundant with creation.

The iPhone, the Phili cheesesteak, the cuban sandwich, classical music, etc.
