# Introduction

According to Gallwey, every game is composed of two parts: (1) an outer game that's played against an external opponent to overcome external obstacles and reach an external goal (2) an inner game played to overcome all habits of the mind which inhibit excellence in performance

While the outer game focuses on practical and technical techniques to master the game, for some reason, we often find the instructions to be easier to remember than to execute.

Victories in the inner game may not provide additions to the trophy case, but they bring valuable rewards which are permanent and which contribute significantly to one's success thereafter--off the court as well. 

The player of the inner game comes to value the art of relaxed concentration above all other skills; he discovers a true basis for self-confidence; and **he learns that the secret to winning any game lies in not trying too hard**.

Side note: Goodness! I just finished reading "The Untethered Soul" by Michale Singer, and he talks about the exact same relaxed attitude. Naval Ravikant also speaks of life being somewhere between effort and settling. Seems like these people are onto something!

The player of the inner game also uncovers a **will** to win which **unlocks all his energy** and which is **never discouraged by losing**.

Side note: Again, Singer in his book talks about the Conscious will!

Accessing the will does not need additional learning, but rather the unlearning of habits that interfere with it; it's about relaxing, and letting go by letting it happen.


# Chapter 1: Reflections on the Mental Side of Tennis

## Summary

The inner game is all about connecting the instruction or intent of what we wish to accomplish to actually execute the action. This is the intention-action gap, and it's fixed by improving the inner game. The player who is on top of his game is the one who plays in stillness of the mind, without consciously thinking about his play.

## Notes
The most common complaint of sportsmen is "It's not that I don't know what to do, it's that I don't do what I know!". In other words, it comes down to execution.

The common complaints are:
- I do well in practice, but fall apart during competition
- I know what I'm doing wrong, but I'm having issues breaking the habit
- When I get close to winning, I get nervous, choke-up, and lose concentration
- I am my own worse enemy

So, here's how Gallwey overcame these issues:

"[from a coach perspective, to his student] One day when I was in a **relaxed** mood, I began saying less and noticing more; errors that I saw but didn't mention were correcting themselves without the student ever knowing he had made them"

Gallwey realized that sometimes, verbal instructions to a conscientious student seemed to *decrease* the probability of the desired correction occurring.

Gallway came to the following conclusion:

> Images are better than words, showing better than telling, too much instruction worse than none, and that conscious trying often produces negative results.

Imagine a player who is on his game. Is he thinking at all? Peak performance comes when we're not thinking about it.

Side note: this is similar to the disciple of Jesus walking on water; the moment he realized he was on water and started thinking, he fell through, yet he was doing just fine before then.

The "hot steak" usually continues until he starts thinking about it and tries to maintain it; as soon as he attempts to exert effort to control, he loses it.

In fact, if you wish to throw your opponent off, simply tell them: "Wow, you've been jumping much higher than usual", or ask, "what are you doing so differently that's making you jump so well today?"--this will usually make him too self-conscious.


# Chapter 2: The Discovery of the Two Selves

## Summary

The inner game can be summarized in three steps:
1. learning to program the moist computer "myself" with images of an ideal goal, rather than verbal instruction
2. Learning to trust thyself 
3. Learning to observe without judgement

## Notes

Here's Gallwey's central claim: the Self is composed of two parts: (1) the "I", which gives instructions on what to do AND evaluates the action performed (2) the "myself" which performs the action.

This leads to the first postulate of the inner game: within each player the kind of relationship that exits between "I" and "myself" is the primary factor in determining one's ability to translate his knowledge into effective action.

In other words, to improve your performance, seek to improve the relationship between the conscious teller ("I") and the unconscious, automatic doer ("myself").

Your self talk ("I") matters tremendously. The "I" is known for complaining, which we know is not a good mental habitual narrative to develop.

Ideally, "I" watches and observe without judgement, while "myself" performs the action without "I" interruption or feedback.

The inner game can be summarized in three steps:
1. learning to program the moist computer "myself" with images of an ideal goal, rather than verbal instruction
2. Learning to trust thyself 
3. Learning to observe without judgement

These three skills combined overcome "trying too hard" and lead to mastery.

# Chapter 3: Getting it Together Part 1: Quieting the Mind

## Summary

## Notes

Harmony between the two selves exists when the mind itself is quiet, for only when the mind is still is one's peak performance reached.

As soon as we reflect, deliberate, and conceptualize the original unconsciousness is lost and the thought interferes.

> Man is a thinking reed but his great works are done when he is not calculating and thinking.

Think back to your greatest race from track. During the race, the mind does not act like a separate entity telling you what you should do nor criticizing how you do it. It is quiet; you're "together", and the actions flow as free as a river.

So, how do you quiet the mind? Stop it! That's it! 

Of course, you cannot prevent a bird from flying over you, yet you can prevent it from building a nest. Likewise, just stop thinking; if a thought comes through, let it pass.
