Singer introduces the main goal of the book, which is to define the concept of the "self" in relation to each of our unique, intuitive experiences.

# Chapter 1: The voice inside your head

## Summary

### One Sentence Summary

You are not your voice, you are your actions.

### One Paragraph Summary

The voice that narrates our world is simply a coping mechanism to protect us from the harsh and uncomfortable realities of the world. In a fake attempt of feeling in control though mental manipulation, we try to present the world in a language that we can understand, rather than the actual truth that really represents reality. The **TRUTH** is that most of life will unfold in accordance with forces far outside your control, *regardless* of what your mind says about it. The key then is to not try to identify with a particular voice, but rather come to the realization that you are not ANY of these voices. 


## Notes

> You have a mental dialogue going on inside your head...notice that the voice takes both sides of the conversation. It doesn't care which side it takes, just as long as it gets to keep on talking.

Damn, this is so true. For me, it's always been about gathering as much pros and cons about a decision.

Imagine you see someone playing chess against themselves. Or imagine you see someone on the street talking to themselves. In both cases, you may wonder, "he obviously knows what's going to be said/do before he says/acts it, so what's the point?"

The same is true for the voice inside your head.

If you watch carefully, you'll see that it's just trying to go back and forth to find a comfortable place to rest.

The best way to free yourself form this incessant chatter is to step back and view it objectively.

The only way to get your distance from the voice is to stop differentiating what it's saying.

As soon as you choose a voice that you identify as "yours", and another being the evil dichotomy, you've lost your objectivity.

If you don't understand the claim that you are not ANY of the voices in your head, then you will continue to try to figure out which of the many things the voice say is really you.

People go though great extents to "find themselves" in the voices when the answer is simple: None of the voices are you.

> Side note: this is WAAYYY different than what Napolean Hill or any other mainstream mindset coach talks about in reference to the "other self", or the "two wolves, one is good, one is bad", or David J. Schwartz in "The Magic of Thinking Big" as the good and bad thoughts.

> Side note 2: To the extent that the following quote matches Singer's claim, I can agree with his central claim: **"I am not my thoughts, I am my actions"**

Much of what the voices say are meaningless. Most of the talking is just a waste of time and energy.

> The **TRUTH** is that most of life will unfold in accordance with forces far outside your control, *regardless* of what your mind says about it.

> Side note: How does this align with what Aristotle speaks about in that "reality is created by the mind"?

> You will someday come to see that there is no use for that incessant internal chatter, and there is no reason to constantly attempt to figure everything out. Eventually, you will see that the real cause of problems is not life itself. **It's the commotion the mind makes about life that really causes problems**.

Singer now begins to ask an important question: if so much of what the voice says is meaningless and unnecessary, then why does it even exist?

The secrete to answering this question lies in understanding *why* the voice says what it says *when* it says it. Here are two main reasons:

1. Most often, the voice is a signal to indicate a weak internal state. There's a buildup of energy inside that needs to be released; the voice talks because you're not okay *inside*, and internal talking *releases* energy.
2. Other times, the voice will act as narration for things that you observe in the real world. These are thoughts, observations, judgments, and opinions about random things (e.g. "what a beautiful day", "that girl is hot", "That's such an ugly sweater").
    - The narration makes you feel more comfortable with the world around you
    - As if you were a backseat driver, it makes you feel as though things are more in your control in spite of not being the driver of the car
    - A tree is no longer just a tree, rather it's something that you saw, labeled, and judged; by verbalizing it internally, you brought that initial direct experience of the world into the realm of your thoughts, from which it becomes integrated with your other thoughts, such as those making up your value system and historical experiences

Now this next section is so well written, that I'm just going to type everything I see because I want to show the whole context.

"
When you're thinking you're free to create whatever thoughts you want in your mind, and these thoughts are expressed though voices. 

This inner world is an alternative environment that is under your control. The outside world, however, marches to its own laws. 

When the voice narrates the outside world to you, those thoughts are now side-by-side, in parity, with all your other thoughts.

All these thoughts intermix and actually influence your experience of the world around you. 

What you end up experiencing is really a personal presentation of the world according to you (**in a language you understand**), rather than the stark, unfiltered experience of what is **really** out there. This mental manipulation of the outer experience allows you to buffer reality as it comes in.

In other words, you manage to control the experience of reality so that it all fits together inside your mind.

Your consciousness is actually experience your *mental model/interpretation* of reality, but not true reality itself. 
"

> You re-create the world within your mind because you can control your mind whereas you can't control the world.

That's why you mentally talk about it; it makes you *feel*, in imaginary land rather than in reality, more empowered.

The **truth** is: this world unfolds in a way that has very little, if anything, to do with your thoughts.

As David J. Lieberman said, reality is here to stay; this world and its reality were here long before you came, and it will be here long after you leave it.

In the futile attempt in controlling the world around you, you're really just trying to hold yourself together.

> True personal growth is about transcending the part of you that is not okay and needs protection from the reality of the world

And this is accomplished by reminding yourself that YOU are the one inside that notices the voice talking. This is the way out.



# Chapter 2: Your inner roommate

## Summary

Inner work is all about working on how well you interpret the events around you. Call it CBT, self-growth, whatever, it's all the same.

## Notes

> Your **inner growth** is completely dependent upon the realization that the only way to find peace and contentment is to **stop thinking about yourself**

Wow, this is similar to what Peterson talks about. The more you think about yourself, the more miserable you become. Isn't it a paradox how "inner growth" is NOT "thinking about yourself"???

> You're ready to grow when you realize that the "I" who is always talking inside will never be content. 

When a problem is disturbing you, instead of asking, "What should I do about this?", ask, "what part of me is being disturbed by this?"

To ask, "what should I do about this?" is to validate the narrative that there really is a problem outside that must be dealt with. But if you wish to achieve inner peace, you must instead understand why you perceive (interpret) a particular situation as a problem.

Side note: This is kinda similar to CBT again; we are changing how we view the events, rather than feeling ashamed of who we are.

> The solution to your every problem starts by asking, "Who notices this inner disturbance?Who is it that sees this?"

Similar to what Eleanor Roosevelt says, "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent"

> The very fact that you can see the inner disturbance means that YOU are not it because the process of seeing something requires a subject-object relationship.

This act of maintaining objective awareness of the inner problem is always better than losing yourself in the outer situation.

The difference between the worldly person and the spiritual person is not in that the worldly person has many material possessions, but rather the worldly person believes that the solution to their inner problems can be found in the outside world. Worldly people believe that if they change things on the outside (moving to a new city, trying a new wardrobe style, earning more money, etc) then they'll be okay on the inside.

Like what David J. Lieberman mentions, no one believes that they can gain better clarity to their problems if they were angry, anxious, or scared; likewise Singer suggests that dealing with our initial *reactions* is the first step in dealing with our problems.

> How are you expected to solve anything outside until you own how the situation affects you on the inside?

You get to break the habit of thinking that the solution to your problems is to rearrange things outside.

The only permanent solution to your problems is to go inside and let go of the part of you that seems to have so many problems with reality; once you take care of that, you'll be clear enough to deal with what's left.

> Ask yourself: Who is it that sees you get angry, insecure, envious, etc? Who notices that changes going on inside? You are the one who's there, noticing these changes. Therefore, you are not these changes. You start by just watching.

Side note: I guess this is the part that clarifies the "other-self" from Napoleon Hill and what Singer is suggesting. Essentially, they're both talking about pretty similar things, but Hill suggest the the "other self" is the negative part of the talking mind while the "self" is the mission-oriented, positive side; per contra, Singer suggests that it's ALL the talking parts that are the "other self", while the "self" is us as individuals noticing and becoming aware of this chatter (both the good and the bad.)

The path to free yourself from negative talk is to simply watch it happen; then, give it a name, body, and personality--it is now someone that's not you. Then, allow it to be your friend. This is what we call inner work: changing the habitual negative thoughts into positive ones.


# Chapter 3: Who are you?

Given the subject-object relation, and knowing that we cannot be that which we observe, then that begs the fundamental question:

> Who am I?

Ask yourself these questions:
- Who sees what I see?
- Who hears what I hear?
- Who knows that I am aware> 
- Who feels fear?

You realize that the outside world and the flow of inner emotions come and go. But you, the one who observes these things, remain continuously aware of whatever passes before you.

So, who are you?


# Chapter 4: The lucid self

## Summary

According to Singer, Consciousness is our ability to become aware of the Self; the self is the entity that is aware and notices the objects around it--be it physical objects that involve our five senses, or inanimate thoughts that involve our emotions, intellect, and reason.

## Notes

Just like in lucid dreaming, lucid awareness is the difference between being aware that you are aware in your daily life, and not being aware while going through the motions.

When you are lucid, you remain inwardly aware that you are the one who is experiencing both the events and the corresponding thoughts and emotions. 

When a thought is created in this state of awareness, instead of getting lost in it, you remain aware that you are the one who is thinking the thought--you are lucid.

The best way to learn about consciousness is through your own direct experience.

The essence of consciousness is awareness, and awareness has the ability to become more aware of one thing and less aware of something else--this is the ability to focus.

The key is that consciousness has the ability to concentrate on different things. In terms of subject-object relation, the subject (consciousness) has the ability to selectively focus awareness on specific objects. If your consciousness concentrates enough on the object itself, your sense of awareness loses itself in the object; it is no longer aware that it is aware of the object; it just becomes object-conscious (this is what it means to lose oneself in his work).

Total consciousness goes beyond the 5 senses; they include the thoughts and emotions as well.

According to Singer, the "lost soul" is the consciousness that has dropped into the place where one human's thoughts, emotions, and sensory perceptions of sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell, are all synchronized.

What differentiates a conscious, centered human from a person who is not so conscious is simply the **focus** of their awareness; it's not a difference in the consciousness itself, because all consciousness is the same, the same way all light from the sun is the same, but may shine on different parts of the environment.  

Consciousness is neither pure nor impure; it has no qualities. It's just there, aware that it's aware. The difference is that when your consciousness is not centered within, it becomes totally focused on the objects of consciousness. When you are a centered being, however, your consciousness is always aware of being conscious. Your awareness of being is independent of the inner and outer objects you happen to be aware of.

If you really want to understand this difference, you must begin by realizing that consciousness can focus on anything, including itself--and this is what true meditation accomplishes. In deep meditation, the focus of consciousness is turned back to the Self; it is the return to the root of your being, the simple awareness of being aware. You are now aware of who you are. You have become an awakened being. You woke up. That is the nature of Self, who you are.

The more you are willing to just let the world be something you're aware of, the more it will let you be who you are--the awareness, the Self, the Atman, the Soul.

# Chapter 5: Infinite Energy

## Summary

The key to accessing the unlimited, internal energy reservoir is by living a life that's authentic and open. This means cultivating the habit of remaining open in spite of how the world responds. The reward is the ever elusive love, enthusiasm, excitement, and energy that every seeks but fails to attain.

## Notes

Inner energy is that sudden spark of instant energy we get when, after months of being depressed, our ex reaches out to us and wants us back, and we instantly become overjoyed. That's the kind of inner energy that Singer is talking about.

This energy is always available to you. At any moment you can draw upon it. It wells up and fills you from the inside, until it overfills to those around you. When you're filled with this kind of energy, you feel like you can take on the world. When it's flowing strongly, you can actually feel it coursing through your veins. 

The only reason why you don't feel this energy all the time is because you block it; you block it by closing your heart, mind, and by pulling yourself into a restrictive space inside, which closes you off from all energy.

When you close your heart or close you mind, you hide in the darkness within you. There is no light. There is no energy. There is nothing flowing. The energy is still there, but it's blocked from usage.

These energy centers are what the yogis call chakras, and the heart is one of the main chakras. But you can call it whatever you want, because different cultures will call it different things ("chi", "spirit, etc.). All great traditions talk about spiritual energy. 

To access this internal energy source, you must simply be open and receptive in your heart; under your control, you can cultivate the habit of being open to people.

Under normal circumstances, our state of openness is left to psychological factors based from our past experience. Unique impressions from past experiences can become activated by certain environmental stimuli.

Side note: Singer suggests that we practice the habit of always being open and receptive. But how does this match with the ugly reality of the real world, and the art of saying less than necessary from books like "48 laws of power"? I think it's a trade off: you can feel enthusiasm, joy, and love at all times regardless of what happens in the external world; or, you can swing in between highs and lows while having a more strategic approach to the outside world.

Singer suggests to learn to stay open no matter what happens. If you do, you get for free what everyone else is struggling for: love, enthusiasm, excitement, and energy.

Side note: to the point that Singer suggested above, I think this would be the same energy that my brother Max has. In his case, he is highly successful, while being highly energetic and enthusiastic. Hell, in that case, I think that's a habit worth developing! Naturally, the question of masculinity comes into play, in which case I defer to the [qualities of a masculine man](https://practicalityandsimplicity.com/posts/high-value-man/). Remember that we become a man the moment we take responsibility for caring for another person.

If you really want to stay open, pay attention when you feel love and enthusiasm. Then, ask yourself why you can't feel this all the time. Why does it have to go away? The answer is obvious: it only goes away if you choose to close.

You feel love until somebody says something you don't like, and then you give up the love. It's your choice. 

Through meditation, awareness, and willful effort, you can learn to keep your centers open. You do this by just relaxing and releasing. 

If you love life, you don't buy into the concept that there is anything worth closing over; nothing every, is worth closing your heart over.

# Chapter 6: The secretes of the spiritual heart

## Summary

Compartmentalization comes at a price of having a blocked heart. The energy flow is real, and unless it's released, it will leak out in unintended and unhealthy ways. The way to be free is to let it go, feel the blockage painfully come out of you, as you setback and relax into the release.

## Notes

Your heart is an instrument made of extremely subtle energy that few people come to appreciate. 

Our ability to give and receive love depends on whether our hearts are open or closed. All these different emotions happen because the heart goes through changes. 

In truth, you are not your heart, the same way you are not your emotions, but you are the experiencer of your heart.

The energy flow we experience during moments of inspiration, enthusiasm, and strength come from the knowing that we are loved--a sense of confidence. This energy flow goes by many names, some of which include Chi, Shakti, and spirit.

The heart controls the energy flow by opening and closing. 

The heart closes when it becomes blocked by stored, unfinished energy patterns from the past.

Our five senses are not windows nor ports through which we experience the world; they are sensory processes that act as electronic sensing devices. 

If the energy patterns that are coming into your psyche create disturbances, you will resist them and create blockage within you.

Ideally, these energy patterns should be gone as soon as you perceive them, like perceiving trees passing by you as you drive your car. When you have no personal issues with these patterns, then these impressions are processed freely. While this system working, you're fine. Driving is an experience, trees passing by are an experience, and cars passing by are an experience. These experiences are gifts that are being given to you, like a great movie.

This is what it means to be alive.

What it means to live life is to experience the moment that is passing through you, and then experience the next moment, and the moment after that. 

It's a phenomenal system when it is working properly. That is how an awakened being lives in the "now". They are present, life is present, and the wholeness of life is passing through them.

However, this system doesn't work when we misuse it by judging and labeling the experiences. Using the car example again, you may see a car that looks like your ex's, and now, a simple car that's driving by has creating narratives in your head that don't allow you to let the experience pass through. 

At the physical level, nothing different is going on. It's just a car that happens to be the same color as your ex's. But at the mental level, the impression did not make it through.

> When the next moment comes, you no longer notice the rest of the trees. You're not seeing the rest of the cars. Your heart and mind are fixated on that one car, even though it's gone.

This is what we call the blockage. All subsequent experiences are trying to pass through you, but something has happened inside that has left this past experience unfinished.

What happens to that experience (the ex, the trauma, the gift, etc) that didn't make it through?

At some point it will disappear from the spotlight as you focus on something else. But what you don't realize is that your entire experience of life is about to change because of what didn't make it through you. Life must now compete with this blockage for your attention, and the impression does not just sit there quietly.

You will find that your thinking tendency will gravitate towards that blockage--constantly. This is an attempt to find a way to process it through your mind. All that inner noise is just your attempt to process the blocked energy and get it out of the way.

Long term, the energy patterns that cannot make it through you are pushed out of the forefront of the mind and held until you are prepared to release them.

Side note: I wonder if this is what Napolean Hill refers to as the dominant thoughts that carry a lot of emotion becomes what we realize in reality.

These energy patterns, which hold tremendous detail about the events associated with them, are real. They don't just disappear. They stay inside you and become a problem because they may be held for very long time and leak into reality in unintended and unhealthy ways.

As you willfully struggle to keep these events from passing through your conscious, the energy first tries to release by manifesting through mind. This is why the mind becomes so active. 

When the energy can't make it through the mind because of conflicts with other thoughts and mental models/concepts, it then tries to release through the heart. That is what creates all the emotional activity. 

When you resist even that release, the energy gets packed up and forced into deep storage within the heart. In the yogic tradition, that unfinished energy pattern is called *Samskara*. A Samskara is nothing more than a blockage/impression form the past.

> A Samskara is nothing more than a blockage/impression form the past.

> From a personal experience, a more familiar language is "compartmentalizing". Eventually, as you fill up your emotional box with these experiences, and then leave it on the shelf to never take it out, it will inevitably overfill and spill when you're least ready and least expecting.

Now, this brings us the the next important question: given that our heart can open and close from our experiences, what causes these frequent changes in the state of the heart?

This happens when a Samskara is stimulated. Maybe some proxy event that triggers unresolved emotions to spring forth. The Samskara opens like a flower and begins to release the stored energy. Suddenly, the flash of what you experienced when the original event took place rush into your consciousness. In an instant, you begin experiencing feelings you left in the past. 

So what's the cure? How do we unblock?

Just let it go.

> When an event triggers a Samskara, simply smile; be happy that this Samskara, which has been stored down there for all this time, has the opportunity to make it through you. Be open, relax your heart, forgive, laugh, or do anything you want--just don't suppress.

Of course it hurts when it comes up; it's stored pain. It's going to release with pain. That's the pain that we "put in the box", and are now paying the debt with.

You have a choice: do you want to try to change the world so it doesn't disturb your Samskara, or are you willing to go through this process of purification?
