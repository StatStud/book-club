# Barack Obama Election Ushers in a different world

"Barack Obama proved that determination combined with opportunity and intelligence can make things happen--and in an exceptional way"

"The world is excited about Barack Obama and the enw United States. Let's keep it that way"

# Essays, Assets, and Stephen King

"I knew that if I did something that was intended to impress the so-called critics that I would be selling not only myself short, but other people as well. That's one reason why I'm liked as well as disliked."

"...one critic...mentioned that I do better when I choose to ignore my critics than when I pay attention to them. I have to agree."

"Being true to yourself and your work is an asset. Remember that assets are worth protecting. No one will ever  tell you it well be easy to stick to your own convictions, but I believe it si necessary."

That's why even an honest man, who has nothing to worry about, must have courage to pursue his truth.

"Keep it straight and simple. You will be richer--in more ways than one--in the long run."

# Innovation

People often talk about something *new* being "innovative". most of the time, it's simply putting together *existing* elements to create what *appears* to be new.

The key is to pay attention and keep your brain and sense open to new stimuli.

Side note: Rick Rubin speaks of the same advice. Keeping your creative athena alert.

It also helps to be thinking of two things at once--multilevel focusing is what I call it. The intersecting of ideas is when innovation will follow.

Don't limit yourself to staid thinking because you want to excel in business...I view business deals as being an art form.

Maybe that's why I've been a successful deal maker. I employ both sides of my brain when I'm thinking and working.

I'm not advising you to dwell on the mysterious--a successful life requires common sense and hard work--but to be aware of things are are sometimes inexpiable because they can ne a big step towards innovation.

Side note: Trump mentions the Golden Ratio as something he is interested in.

> We don't really create, but we **assemble** what has been created for us.

# The importance of being a team player

As you will discover as you gain wisdom over the years, most of the things you do will rarely be just about you.

> "Everyone had a good time, and everyone won"


# An early Thanks Giving

> Find a blessing in the midst of adversity

# Learning is a new beginning 

Being a know-it-all is like shutting the door to great discoveries and opportunities; keep your door open every day to something new and energizing.

Start every day with a blank slate.

Never think of learning as being a burden or studying as being boring. It may require some discipline, but it can be an adventure.

# Learn to Think on you Feet

"A leader has the right to be beaten, but never the right to be surprised"-Napoleon Bonaparte

The same way how learning and the right attitude opens doors; the opposite holds true for complacency.

Being complacent is like being in a rut and deciding to be there.

That's why I like to advise people to live on the edge--it's the opposite of complacency, and the same as thinking on your feet.

Being on the edge gives you extra energy from the adrenaline rush and heightened state of focus.

If you see everyday as a challenge, you'd be surprised how efficient you can become and how much can be accomplished

One of the most obvious lessons on **The Apprentice** is for the candidates to learn to think quickly. They are under a time constraint to finish their assignments, and we've noticed, it's important that they have a plan B in line. If plan A doesn't work, they're prepared for it and they won't lose much time. They are learning to think ahead and cover their bases. 

# Strive for wholeness

I've encountered people who don't wonder about anything...don't let yourself fall into that category. Don't ever sell yourself short. That's bad business on every level, even the metaphysical.

We've seen empires come and go, and survival of the fittest take place. Things change. We get to keep up with the changes and move forward. 

As the Trump Organization has moved forward, I have seen it as a living organism that needs to be fed...I can't have any missing pieces. I can't have any ingredients that aren't the best. Those are my standards, and it's my responsibility to make sure they are kept.

See yourself as an organization. Pay attention to every facet of your life. What's strong? What's weak? What's missing? What can you do to make the big picture better?

Whatever you do, don't stagnate. Don't become complacent. Things move too quickly today to fall into that trap.

When I realized how fast the world moves, I decided to double up on my work hours. That wasn't a big sacrifice because I love what I'm doing and I've always been a hard worker. I'm happier and more productive than I ever was.

You can adapt or you can lose out. I chose to adapt.

I kept the pace in order to keep up with my environment, which is a fast one. People who want to compete with me will have to keep up with me.

Don't be the guy who can't adapt--even Darwin would agree.

Very few of us are completed projects. It's an ongoing process.


# Give your higher self a chance

When the achiever achieves, it's not a plateau, it's a beginning.

Achievers move forwards at all times. It's enthusiasm that can't be fabricated. It's either there or it's not.

Achievers go for the challenge, so the next deal is what they're thinking about.

They have an obligation to themselves to best themselves. That's living in the highest realm.

Your higher self is in direct opposition to your comfort zone.

You've heard people refer to a city as vibrant; what that means is that it's growing and lively--not stagnant. See yourself as a city.

Our higher selves can serve to transport us to becoming visionaries.

> One of the worst fears we have is the fear to attempt something. 

You miss 100% of the shots you don't take

I wasn't sure if I'd be a success on radio, but I went for it anyway, and it was a big hit. I had to take the chance first to find out.

# Wisdom

What I realized is that wisdom comes as a result of several factors: one being experience, and one being knowledge.

It's something you can't teach someone else--you have to achieve it on your own.

It's very hard for me to just give you this wisdom--you have to get there yourself.

Another way to gain wisdom is to read about the greats in history and those in your specific domain.

I remember realizing back in school that two things in particular seemed to shape the world as I knew it: war and nature.

It's worth spending some time to know how and why we are where we are today.

# The more you learn, the more you realize you don't know

I see no value whatsoever in believing ignorance to be an attribute. It isn't.

> Not studying history is like being a leaf that didn't know it was part of a tree.

We are individually responsible for our education, and that applies whether you're in school or working.

There is no ceiling to learning. You will never know it all, but it's a fantastic way of practicing longevity

# Think like a champion

What comes to mind when I see their amazing ability is the amount of training they have endured, the sacrifices they've made, and the courage they've had to have to get where they are.

They also wanted to achieve something special. Ordinary wouldn't be enough for someone who was of the mindset of a champion.

Champions think big.

Champions are focused; they are disciplined.

> A champion is someone who gets up when he can't.

I've seen very talented people fail because deep down I think they were afraid of winning.

Winning comes with responsibility, and it takes courage to willingly accept that responsibility.

# I view my work as an art form

Artists are known for their dedication to 
1. their ideals
2. their muse, and 
3. their perseverance in getting things just right. 
Those are the admirable traits to possess.

Compete with yourself to be the best version of yourself--that's the mindset of the entrepreneur.

Entrepreneur know that competing with others might lower their own standards.

You get to have your own vision and stick with it.

Don't be afraid to be unique; it's like being afraid of your best self.

> No one cares about the blood, sweat, and tears that art or beauty can require. It's the end result that matters.

Art is also representational--it's not life, but it's about life.

Art can point to truths that we might not notice in our busy lives. It gives us a reflection.

I strive for a comprehensive approach, much as an artists would. No matter your field, you can learn a lot by emulating that approach as much as possible. 

My work as a builder combines both craftsmanship and art, and I refuse to settle for less.

I didn't have to use a rare marble when I built Trump Tower, but it would make a difference and I knew it.

Don't sell yourself short. Life is an art, business is an art, so be an artist and best yourself.

# Building connected thoughts 

Comprehensive education dissolves the line between knowing too much on one subject and knowing too little on a variety of subjects.

> Read: "Integrated Education", by Aldous Huxley, 1959. 

In the referenced essay above, Huxley emphasized the importance of building bridges in knowledge and thought, and the word he mentions for this is **pontifex**, or bridge builder.

By building these connected thoughts, we increase our learning capacity to include and connect ideas and subjects that may not specifically pertain to our area of interests, but that may serve us well to pay attention to.

We all know the saying, "connect the dots". I see it as having enough knowledge to *be able* to connect the dots ina reasonable and informed way.

The tunnel-visioned man I interviewed could not do this. I wasn't asking for an in-depth review of each topic presented, but an *awareness* of at least what the topic was.

I've mentioned before the importance of keeping up with global events on a daily basis if you are planning to get anywhere in this world.

Another tactic for being your own bridge-builder is to visualize how much time is saved when you cross a bridge, versus fording a river, or traversing a canyon.

It's a safeguard for falling into a gap that might take you weeks or months to get yourself out of.
